"I throughly enjoyed The Selection series, but thought this novella was a bit of a letdown even though you have a glimpse into the restrictive life of the Prince as seen through his eyes. In this story Maxon's relationship with Daphne seems to be all one-sided, although the story does give a further glimpse into his relationship with his manipulative father and his view on love and finding a wife. The story's only redeeming quality was to reveal Maxon's stifling lifestyle and his need to gain control over his own life. This was probably most apparent in his perception of the Selection, his meeting with America and his need to review the candidate files. I don't think you need to read the novella to understand the Prince, although it was entertaining.",0
"This is one of the most dissapointing purchases ever. The formatting errors were so bad it was hardly readable!!!!! But what was there seemed really good! :( At the end of each paragraph, the next paragraph seemed like it was missing several words or sentences, EVERY TIME, but when thre was a long paragraph i enjoyed the writing! oh sad day, If anyone figures out how to fix this PLZ do so.",0
"""Oh yeah, come to the party,"" Emma had said. ""Simon will be there and he wants you,"" she said. When did that transform into getting torn to shreds by an evil bitch? Becky isn't about to let Livia get a piece of her without giving something back, but those sure are some strange sounds coming out of that woman. Finding out that your best friend, your best friend's new boyfriend, and the man you have been lusting after are other than human is a bit of a shocker, but Becky is no weak-willed lady Plus, she has to decide the fate of the bitch that had attacked her.When Simon finally gets Becky secured in his home, the Puma in him purrs. If he had any doubts at all about her being his mate, they had been erased at the scent of her blood and the sight of Livia crouched over her in the Friedelinde's garden. It was a good thing Becky had not even jokingly mentioned killing Livia as Livia's punishment for attacking her, because Simon would not have hesitated killing Livia for spilling his mate's blood. In fact, it had only been the fear in Becky's face, fear of him, that had stopped him from doing that anyway. He would have to work on that fear.We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in ""The Wallflower"", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it. If I had one problem with this story it was that it was too darn short and that I didn't want it to end, but if that isn't the best recommendation I can give for a story, I just don't know what is.",1
"I felt the book started out just a tad slow but boy when it took off, it was great. I will definitely read more of this author's books and look forward to it.",1
"This is an absolutely awesome buy if you're interested in starting the Steele series. Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna. Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa' stories. Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together. Lots of mischief. Sebastian(Bas) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel. Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word. Then you have Morgan who finally found Lena Spears, his perfect woman, even if she doesn't agree with him. Can't not love a beautiful man that loves your family too. Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy, the delicious Cameron Cody, who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting. Taking matters into his own hands, he lays out a proposition she can't, and deep down doesn't want to refuse. All the stories in the bundle are well worth the read and I found them all thoroughly hot and enjoyable. Great value on a great read.",1
"It was an interesting read, it was written by his sister and I really liked her impressions and feelings you can feel they were close-nit family. It is so captivating to read about the early church days and the struggles, and hardships they were able to overcome.",1

"Interesting book about the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in the 1800s etc. The Indian author Andrew Blackbird wanted to get an education, and was a hard worker, but the money that was sent by the US Government, was not really available to him, as the system, including agents and friends disposed of it first. Another documented case where the system of Indian Agents really did not work well for the Indians, but rather was used by the agents for their benefit. Typical where the system is captured by the persons operating the system, and not by the people the system was set up to serve. He did an excellent job of collecting historical information, and creating a english to the local indian tongue dictionary. A little gem of a book.",1
Maggie Shayne intertwines people in such a way it captivates you. I plowed through the stories! Great plots and action.,1
"Can't say I've subscribed yet, but I have picked up an occasional issue of Reader's Digest on the Kindle.  It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.  Even if you usually read weightier fare on your Kindle, you may just find the content and visual flair of Reader's Digest on the Kindle to be an occasional refreshing change.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.",1
This story was simply ridiculous. Even the sex. was not even close to a turn on. I should be able to charge this author for the time it took me to read it. Please...tree sex with werewolves? Not good at all. Free is not an excuse for this,0
"If your looking for adventure you will be dissapointed, aside from the Time Machine and War of the worlds the stories from H G Wells are more dedicated to love and relationships in which there are in excess of a dozen.Love is a complex subject matter as witnessed by our author, untill our final story the compexity of relationships is laid bare with complete understanding.I have read this works in conjunction with the works of Jules Verne which I also give 5 stars. To sum up for the reader: One is the master of understanding love and romance in the narrative the other is the master of adventure and imagination.Both books are amazing value, containing endless hours of enjoyment.",1
"They are some stubborn, stubborn, did I mention STUBBORN, people. The sex in this story was HOT but all of the underhandedness and temper tantrums that went on were pretty frustrating and quite funny too. I liked this story a lot and had to finish it before I could do anything else. In other-words I couldn't put it down. Thank Goodness for a HEA (happily ever after). I recommend this book.",1
the beginning was interesting and then quickly became silly. everything is so rushed! within one month he says &#34;become a vampire and we will live forever together&#34;. worse yet is she says ok with no questions asked. the plotline was just strange and rushed. there was no real emotions in the characters and the sex scenes were just plain sad. the entire book was him apologizing and her saying everything will be ok. i wanted to like it but had to force myself to finish it (i skimmed the last chapters). the ending is just plain ridiculous!  what a waste of two hours......,0
I hadn't read this series before and was surprised how nice it is. It made me laugh but it made me wish also that these types of men existed. It was hard to put down.,1
"Two cowboys save a lady running from a cheating ex.A strong story that shows how fast love can develop when the time is right, and for these three it is so right and sexy.Kate is okay and gets better as the story grows, so does she.Bobby and Cale are layed back cowboys with alot of depth.Finding such gentle yet hard men would be any womens dream come true.Have a glass of iced tea handy, turn on the ceiling fan andenjoy a hot read.",1
"I would have given this book a 4.5 just for the editing problems but gave it a five instead of a four out of frustration at the negative reviews. I had this book sitting on my kindle for a week or so not bothering to read it because some of the reviews made it sound only mediocre. I sat down and read this through in one sitting. It was great. It did have quite a few typos, and misprints but for crying out loud its a self published book THATS FREE!I would love it if the author was able to make the book $3.00 and get some money for his work so that he could write a second. For a debut novel which I believe this is, it was a stellar performance. The character development was great. I could have used a little more antagonist descriptions ( its good to also get to know the bad guys we don't like), but the good guys were very knowable lovable. Sure parts were a little far fetched but its fantasy fiction?This book is chock full of heroism, good characters making common sense decisions honorably and humor.I would really like to see the story develop more, and a great way to do it would be to write it from the perspective of other survivors and give more ""alien"" information. HINT HINT.I would buy a book two for anything under $5.00 (my usual kindle cap) without hesitation.The language and sexuality and violence would all be rated about a soft PG-13. The sexuality in the book is just verbal discussions about sex not actual descriptions. I will recommend this to my older teen not my younger one yet.",1
"This book dashes in circles, always relying on the same, redundant information to keep readers reading. I was so bored at the end, I sped read and didn't actually care about whodunit. I didn't feel like the characters were developed nearly enough.",0
"Plot:Oriana crash lands her plane in Alaska. Stumbling through the forest she comes across the Werebears bunker. When they return from their walk and find her asleep in Jonathon's bed, they decide to keep her. But can the four of them find a happy, albeit erotic, future together, or is it really just a fairy tale?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) erotic romance.- 3329 kindle locations (finishes around 3200 locations)- m/f - varied, explicit, caring. Some bdsm-lite behavior including hot wax, erotic spanking, mild humiliation, Dominant Alpha males, anal play. No m/m (brothers). Aiming for a committed foursome.- Quite a few editing and proofreading issues on my e-version. Enough to irritate and detract from this reader's enjoyment.Opinion:A very relationship-driven erotic romance following our Goldilocks as she takes on her three were-bears. Not a menage - Oriana never takes on more than one bed partner at a time - but highly erotic and varied as the Men show their different tastes. I liked Oriana - she was sweet and caring and very willing to go with the flow. She needed somewhere to just *be* and someone to simply love her. Getting three sexy men just makes it all the more fun. It's enjoyable, nicely written, and an easy way to pass the time.3.5 stars because of the editing issues, rounded up to 4 because Fanning made Goldilocks work, and made me laugh.Aside:Reminded me a lot ofMikayla's Menby Abby Blake - a sweet, easy woman who just wants to find a comfortable place to be loved. And her men who have differing needs and are simply looking for a woman to care for, protect and nurture.-CR-",1
"The hero and heroine aren't that great, but the plot is excellent with a mystery to solve and a marriage to save. Emily is one of my least favorite character types - afraid of everything. Afraid to love her husband because he might break her heart again, afraid to attend any ""ton"" events because people will not accept her, etc... And worse, instead of telling her husband about her fears, she resorts to manipulation to solve her problems. On the plus side, she has a good heart and ALWAYS has the best interests of her loved ones in mind. Lord Whitmore is another of my least favorite characters types - selfish. He does warm up and evolves into a good husband and father to Emily's niece and nephew. And once he gets his priorities straight, he puts in the effort to be a mind reader to figure out what will make Emily happy.Overall the book was an enjoyable read because the plot is very interesting. The H/h are both flawed but balanced with other good qualities and as the story develops they become more likable. The writing is excellent and well edited. There are multiple explicit scenes which can be skipped if that's an issue for you. I'd recommend this book if you're in the mood for a good mystery/romance.",1

"Three college friends tackle the adult world. MJ pursues a graduate degree at an unnamed British university and finds herself pursued by several men; Claudia follows her boyfriend to his new job in the Midwest and tries to make it as a writer; Sophie hates her advertising dream job and finds a new and unexpected career.I borrowed this book from another Kindle owner through the Lendle.me website. The three separate storylines are confusing at times, and it's just unbelievable that all three young women have men dripping off them. But many of the problems they face are similar to problems that my own twenty-something children are facing, so I didn't have any problem believing the rest of the book, and the stories kept me reading. Kindle formatting was okay. The book title was okay although not uniquely appropriate.",1
"I liked this book very much. Very well written, with well developed characters, and an interesting plot.I find it hard to see how Antonio could love Gabriel, but the other side, Gabriel loving Antonio is very well depicted and beautiful.",1
"total crap.  It was written as if the characters have the IQ and maturity of 14 year olds given a mission of supreme importance and using technology giving them limitless possibilities and power.  And the whole book continues on like that...this book has nothing to provoke either thought or excitement.  There is no real drama to any of the relationships, and when something does happen...they just handle it simple and quick with no problems.  Yea right.",0
"You want &#34;White Guys and their Black Side-Kick Versus Weird Places&#34; type stories, here's one. I only read it because I read League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which features a far more interesting Allan Quatermain. This wasn't bad, though.",1
"Since I bought the sequel, I guess I enjoyed it. I found myself comparing it to Juster`s Phantom Tollboth and thinking Phantom  was better. But I found that I liked the Langman characters enough to care about them, and the plot interesting enough to wonder what happens next. Tollbooth may be a masterpiece, but so far Logic is a pretty fun read.  At this point I`d give Logic a 92 on a scale where Phantom Tollbooth was 100.  That`s pretty good; I`ll read the sequel next and review it to let y`all know if  made a mistake.",1

Both men fall in love with her but Alex secretly also loved Charlie. Allie travels the world for six years, grows and gets her wanderlust out of her system before coming home to find the feelings she has for Alex and Charlie are still as intense.

They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other, their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book, it was beautiful, sweet, sad in places and oh ever touching, watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life.",1

"I took advantage of the freeAmazon Dailyblog right after I received my Kindle in 2009. Have seen it evolve over that time, and generally speaking it's been for the better... not perfect, but I do like it for it's often-random yet usually informative content.The range of articles is wide, much like thumbing through a magazine or Sunday newspaper supplement, with something there for just about anyone. It's not a Kindle blog; it's more widely-spaced covering not just books, music and such.

I should have stopped reading when I read Keep on Truckin by Al Green. (Eddie Kendricks was the singer). This book was full of inconsistencies like that. The music says one decade but the clothing and cars give you a different decade. And then the ending was totally disappointing. The story line doesn't match the title.,0
"Let me be frank up front.  I am a Christian with all that implies.  Yet I did not like this book and I am not sure I am going to ever read another book by this artist.  From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.  Anything by Bill Myers makes this guy look worse than amateurish, though his Charismatic leanings come through pretty strongly.  Look, just find something else to buy.  This book isn't worth the effort.",0
"Nothing makes me madder than to start reading what seems like an excellent novel, and find out it is about a chapter long. Darn it! I want the rest of the book, not some abruptly ending short story. This writer is excellent, too bad the rest of the story was missing.",0
"Got this book as a freebie, as I do for most of what I read on the Kindle, and really wanted to like it as I enjoy suspense with a bit of romance.  It started out fine but like others have mentioned, it got very political and frankly I just thought these characters were paranoid.  There was no entertainment in this book for me--just a message. There was also way too much dialogue and not much description--unless they're discussing something in the arsenal or vintage car garage.Anyways, I got about 30% into it and couldn't read any more so I scrolled to the end.  Read about 4 more pages and was done.  Didn't make it to the end and frankly I don't even care about these characters.Not for me at all.",0
this was a good book but it left you wondering what happened and if there were going to be more books to follow but good just the same,1
"Meli Galdes is ready to retire. She's dedicated her life to her family as an assassin and kinsmen, using her genetically enhanced skills as a melder. Her world is a tough one, where greed and power go hand in hand with the abilities of the kinsmen. Her family has one last request of Meli, however, one that will send her back into her past memories. Can Meli kill Celino Carvanna, the man who broke her heart and set her on her current course?Ilona Andrews crafts a darkly alluring world in which death and assassination are merely par for the course in the business world. I wasn't sure how I'd like such a bleak and harsh world, but Ilona Andrews does a marvelous job at pitting the characters against their world. Meli and Celino have fought their own inner demons and sought to find their own ways in a world where the family decides everything. It's hard not to admire those traits in them, even as their mindset about killing is so foreign to me.SILENT BLADE is an unusual story. Ilona Andrews takes a seemingly unlikable world and concept and makes it both sensuous and likable. I can only hope that this is the start of a series as I want to see more of the world of the kinsmen! Highly recommended!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES",1
"Great book packed full with fast cars , crazy hot men, and danger... and oh yes great sex!",1
"I liked the premise behind the plot, mental attachment between wolf and man, as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately, for me, the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me, the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated, the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book, just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me.",0

"I couldn't remember if I had ever read anything by Vivian Arend so got ""Wolf Signs"" when it was a freebie back in April (bypassed the Kindle version and downloaded a different format). I tend to avoid novelettes but after being disappointed by another book, this story was the perfect escapist feel-good pick-me-up--enjoyable so long as one keeps in mind the following: ""destined mate/instant love"" means near-instant sex; at less than 100 pages, the plot points have to arise and be resolved at hyper-speed; and the story is not intended to be a heavy, serious paranormal/urban fantasy. It is definitely ""erotica"" but considering that it's a Samhain product, I found the sex scene pretty tame and almost secondary to the overall story.The story is well-written and includes a fairly well-developed storyline for its short length (with enough tidbits for future books in this series). The characters, for the most part, are likable and memorable in that each deviated in some way from shifter/were stereotypes. I especially loved the walking disaster (in human form) that was TJ, the brother. In contrast, I tried to like Robyn more but for some reason, I found her annoying at times, and I just couldn't get over the deaf-person-going-backcountry-alone-is-not-TSTL hurdle. (Oh yeah, and that deaf person is a lone female staying at a communal cabin.)On the flip side, the alpha challenge? BOO! HISS! OK, maybe I'm a little bloodthirsty but it was described as ""to the death"" (*gasp*) and it turned out to be...not. Given how it occurred, the end result jumped the rails in favor of the story's funnier side. I also wouldn't have minded something at the end to address, however briefly, how much Robyn's adoptive parents knew about her wolf heritage (since her adoptive brother did).",1
I enjoyed reading this book.  I giggled and picked it up back up whenever I had the chance.  I enjoy each of the characters and the story line. Easy read and recommend!,1

"Cyn Elder had planned a quiet night at home, but those plans were derailed when her friends dragged her to a new night club where she met prince charming. As a silent partner for the club, Parker Maguire wanted to see the fruits of his investment but soon met a fiery and sassy Cyn having words with his bouncer. Their priorities shifted as Cyn and Parker got to know each other but there was a threat to their relationship in the form of two lazy daughters of her dad's girlfriend who were plotting the demise of this new relationship.A Cinderella Story had all the ingredients of the original version but came to life into a twenty first century happy ever after fairy tale. From two lazy daughters from the step-mother's side, to the hardworking princess, fairy god mother, the ball and yes, the glass slipper.

"I've seen a bunch of bad ratings for this FREE ebook and I must disagree.  This was a free ebook which I feel had a purpose to entice the ebook reader to download it and see what the series had to offer.I have read all of the Henry Parker books and I consider myself a fan.  Reading this FREE ebook took less than a day.  I liked it because it gave me the sense that Jason was talking to me for a brief moment about where the series now sits and where it's going.This ebook was released the month in between THE FURY and THE DARKNESS.  For anybody that watches TV, we all know about teasers.  Give the author more credit especially since he didn't charge you for something that still took him time to write and publish.Last but not least, this ebook built the suspense from THE FURY to THE DARKNESS effectively (especially the last couple pages).",1
"The novel may be missing sections in the kindle edition.  Characters are put into play without clear introduction and the story jumps without transitions.  On one page she is leaving to go to Gran's, the next she is in bed having sex with her ex.  I gave up a third of the way into the book.  I was not interested in the characters and the story wasn't engaging enough to warrant a greater investment of time.",0
"Ricky Sides hits it out of the park with ""The Birth of the Peacekeepers"". His real world experience in Martial Arts and Survival training show throughout the book for all the main characters. The story is set in a USA which has rapidly gone down the tubes into anarchy due to a series of natural distasters some of which are centered around Military Bases. In this chaos, the main character sets out to find his brother who was in the Army. The story scenes are well thought out including the action. The main bad guy develops well into the story but he is rotten to the core. Ricky also uses him in a surprise ending so expect to see him in future stories. The ending itself is full of action after the main character's little brother shows up. If you would like to learn some common sense survival techniques along with a good action/adveture read, this is a good place to start.",1
it showed what love should be. time and distance should not erase love. i loved the hero and he really loved the heroine. he showed that man can love only one woman. no amount of time or distance can change feelings.,1

"I enjoyed this story by Kallysten (as I have all that I've read by her).  Brett is human and the owner of On The Edge, a club that caters to both vampires and humans.  Lisa is his vampire lover and silent partner.  They have a good relationship, one that isn't the usual vampire-human one in that Lisa hasn't bitten Brett (she doesn't want to see him as food).  She is on the hunt one evening in the club and is surprised to see Leo, her old lover and fellow vampire.  She couldn't remember why they had parted 15 years ago but found it wonderful to be in Leo's arms again.  From this point on, (no I'm not going to spoil it for you), you read about how Lisa, Brett and Leo develop a relationship between themselves.  It is a hot and spicy read and I am looking forward to reading the next story, Over The Edge, that continues Brett, Lisa and Leo's story.I received an ebook from the author for the purpose of an honest review. All comments are my own and I was not compensated for this review.",1

"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there, and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too.",1
"Good horror stories are hard to write.  They come in many shapes and forms.  They may not be what you might expect.  When it comes to Spinetinglers, we are talking excellent.  Enjoy the stories in this volume.  They are that good.  As a writer I am very impressed.Demon's Daughter: The Full Circle of Trouble",1
"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise, this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself, I'd like to suggest the ""Burnt Orange Nation"" blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings.",1
"Sheridan ""Sheri"" Montgomery is a puma who also has albinoism (her definition - not an albino), she is also a victim of abuse by her boyfriend a wolf shifter who attacked her. She was injured so severely that Max Cannon, a friend turned her into a puma to help her recover from her injuries. Along with her albinoism, she is legally blind. After being found whenever she moved she finally contacts Max to ask for help from him and his pride of pumas.Sheri has just moved to Halle and is working part time for the mates of the Alpha and Beta, but she needs to be introduced to the pride and approved as a pride member. Adam Giordano the pride Marshall is delegated to give her a ride to the pride meeting, as soon as he sees and scents her he realizes that she is his mate, Sheri realizes the same thing but both of them deny their feelings - of course that doesn't last for long.Sheri's attacker has followed her to Halle, Max the puma leader contacts the Alpha wolf from the Poconos pack for help against the rogue wolf and his small pack, Sheri is guarded and Adrain steps up to make sure she is protected by him - her mate. Sheri knows that Adrian will be attacked when the crazy wolf realizes they are together.The plotline for this was tight and very well conceived, the action is still limited by the length of the book but I liked this story very much. Especially the viewpoint from Sheri as an albino.Again a great series -not dark and brooding.",1
"I downloaded this for free on July 4th and honestly; I could not finish it. I read three chapters and I was done with it. I like erotic but I love werewolves more, and I didn't feel the connection of werewolves whatsoever. The cover picture would have been better if it actually depicted what was in the book, and leave out the wolf.  Disappointed? Yes.",0
I enjoyed it. I love light reads and love stories and a little added adventure made it fun. Nice writing style.,1
"I read about 25% now, and there's still no hint of any romantic interest from any main character. Other than that major disappointment, it's too mundane and slow most of the time, with too much redundancies and things that go without saying, as if written for slow-wits.",0
"This is a very emotional addition to Zsadist and Bella's story.  I couldn't put it down until the end.  If like me, Z's story was your favorite out of all the BDB novels, this is a MUST READ.  I was putting off reading it because I knew it was a novella and I always want more to those stories, but this was soooo worth it.  I'll say it again...I want a Zsadist!!",1
This book reminds me a lot of Skin Deep; both are enjoyable and different enough that you won't be disappointed. I liked Lila and the decisions she chose to make for herself. I didn't find anything wrong with the arrangement and enjoyed how the story ended.,1
"After reading the entire Star Wars:Legacy of the Force series I decided that I would commit to the next one, the Fate of the Jedi.  In the second book in the series (Omen)we are introduced to a new Sith culture, one that has been accidentally seperated from the rest of the galaxy for the last 5000 years.  This is very different from the ""There can only be Two"" Sith culture, which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story, The Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh.  Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith.  If you plan of reading TFOTJ: Omen, this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time.  I am guessing there will be several short books in this series, each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories.  Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging.  It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy, the Sith.  I look forward to the next stories in this clever series.Omen (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi, Book 2)",1
"I downloaded this book free so the only thing that I really wasted was my time.  Based on the positive reviews I figured that it would be a nice diversion on a long commute home from work. However I spent my time slightly annoyed and perplexed to the point where I skimmed the book rather than read it fully.  I found the main character very... childish and silly... not to mention the many annoying times she said ""Isn't it Romantic"" when there was (***SPOILER***) NOTHING romantic about convincing a guy to pose as a fake husband then bulling the man into doing everything that she asked- even though he was doing her the favor. She was unsympathetic to his ""allergy"" to dogs and within one day already tried to change him into her picturesque dream guy. I found it to be a complete mystery that he would fall in love with her so quickly and that, with such an overbearing father, she would even bother pretending to have a husband just to make him happy.  What was supposed to be zany and humorous was silly and sophomoric. I am sorry that I did not listen to the negative review. So...was it awful? No. But I will not be reading another Ellen Fisher book.",0
"A well written and very highly developed Paranormal world of werewolves, Cry Sanctuary  sucks you in immediately as the action begins from the onset and keeps going to the end. The book follows the story of Abigail, whom is rescued by a friend from a sadistic Alpha and brought to Red Rock, Montana. There Abigail meets Keith who is a bit troubled by his past, but can't deny the urge to ""protect"" Abigail. The crazy, sadistic Alpha that made Abigail won't let go, though and when he kidnaps Abagail's sister to lure her from Red Rock --- Keith and Abigail must break every rule to save her.This was a great Kindle Free Find and I enjoyed the read, the action, the sexy goodness and the author's writing. I hadn't read Moira Rogers before so this was a wonderful introduction. I can't wait to read more of her writing.RECOMMENDATIONS: Paranormal Romance fans should enjoy. There are some intense sexual encounters, so mature readers only.",1
HEHEHE this book for me was crazy but in a good way intense. I loved it great read,1
"I was very excited to find a book that not only had great characters, but it was also written by an author who knew how to write. The twist at the end I should have seen coming, but I didn't and it still made perfect sense. I look forward to reading more by this author and more books with Henry Wright. I appreciate a good mystery that doesn't have alot of violence, or to have psychopaths or sex included just to have it and for no other reason than as a shock. Excellent read.Highly recommend.",1
Not much of a story. Too stylized for me to follow as well.  I'd advise passing on this one.  Too hard to follow here.  Much better free stuff out there.,0
"What happens when a serial killer picks up a serial killer? A whole lot of fun when Kilborn and Crouch are at the helm. The two killers are deliciously twisted as we're introduced to them while they do what they do best. One of them is especially wicked and she'll make you think twice about picking up strangers... especially when they're toting a guitar case.If you're looking for a quick read, you can't go wrong with Serial.",1
"I really did. The story premise is good and I like the split narrative between 1912 and 2012. The technology the author introduces stretches credulity a bit, but I can live with that just fine; the book is fiction trending toward science fiction after all.All of the good ideas are wiped away by one key failing as far as I can tell: no editor. Or, if an editor was used that person was, well, not very good. A good editor could have easily cut 20,000 or more words out of the book and it would have been much better for it. An editor would, I hope, have caught a mistake like this from a scene where characters in 1912 are discussing armaments available to them on the Titanic:""I want one of those!"" probably have had some Lee Enfield MKIII Short Rifles on board for close confines of ship. It was in .303 British caliber a pretty potent round up to 300 yards. You can probably google those weapons if you need more particulars.""If I thought it would do any good other than getting more men killed than these disgusting creatures"", Murdoch replied, ""I'd break into the Vickers machine guns on board.""The author's note to himself to do a little more research on SMLE rifles finds its way into the final text.There are many other examples similar to this one throughout the book. Not author notes appearing, but problems that never would have been had a good editor been used.The author came up with what I think was a very good idea for a story with a different take on the Titanic disaster and it could have been epic. But the editorial mistakes really distract from any tension that the story might otherwise create.",0
"The adapter was for my mom who doesn't have a computer.  Frankly, I think they should come standard with a Kindle.  Its much handier to be able to plug into any wall source than find a computer.  The product works as promised.",1
"I've been really curious about this book and had it on my TBR list for a while, but it wasn't until I read Mariya's review that I was coerced into buying the book... and unholy hell what a read!!I don't read many M/M Romance books, but it's not because I don't like, oh believe me, I do! I just haven't found the right book, series, or author to drag me (willingly of course ;) into the M/M world. But I think Evangeline just did that for me.Plot wise, Str8te Boys isn't much of a read, but Maverick and Duke were so entertaining I honestly could care less what they did outside that apartment. I'm double daring these hotties to keep rubbing their big, muscular bodies and c***s to one another while making out with lust-filled hunger until they come on each other!Unholy hell... where are my ice buckets?!!!I thought the whole concept for ""gay chicken"" was ridiculous, especially considering that no straight man in his right mind would let another man touch his junk. But here's where thngs get interesting, because Duke and Mav have taken their ""game"" to extreme possibilities. I love that these guys are jocks. They've been playing in the same soccer team for the past four years (plus in my book, I love soccer players ;)), and they've been roomies and bff's since their freshmen year of college. Str8te Boys is told from Maverick's POV, and it's interesting because as ""uncomfortable"" as he gets when Dukes talks guy on guy action, he still allows him to get close. To play with his c*** to kiss, to lick... and so many other sinfully delicious things.Duke is suppose to be straight as well, according to Mav, but it didn't take long for me to begin to question these guys' sexual orientation, and then things really take off when Duke and Mav go to a photo shoot together. Basically a porn site for gay men with straight looking ones.The more Duke and Mav's relationship progresses, the more Mav begins to question his nature. Everything seems perfect for the two until a late night trip to the drugstore ends with Duke's heart being broken. Now, Mav must come to terms with who he truly is, or risk losing not only his best friend, but his heart as well.Like I said, the idea of ""Gay Chicken"" for me was ridiculous, but so very clever at the same time. Both Mav and Duke were great characters. I would have loved seeing some soccer action, and them interacting outside of each other. But the scenes were so delicious between these two I'll happily shut up as long as I get front row seats and touch action! *Rawr* ;) I'll be sticking to Evangeline Anderson for more sinfulness from now on.",1

"Ok, they say this is a short story, but my Lord I didn't realize that s short story was shorter then my high school term paper.  It could have been a really great novel if the author had spent time developing the story!  It was a good storyline, but boo for Kindle!  they need to let you know when you are purchasing short stories.  There needs to be instead of telling us the freaking file size ALLmof the books should have what the print pages would be, that way there are no unhappy people from buying expecting a novel and getting a book report.",0
The eye is in the beholder. Appearances shouldn't matter. It is what the heart feels. Plus the few love scenes were just right.,1
"I'm so glad that I didn't pay for this! It was horrible. I skipped several chapters just to get to the good stuff, which never happened. I liked that it happened in my hometown of Nashville, but other than that, it literally sucked. It took way too long for the characters to have sex. They supposedly had all this chemistry but it took them forever to dance between the sheets. Stupid dialogue and I seriously doubt it had professional editing. I almost screamed when the male character said, ""I could of"" instead of ""I could have"" HAVE not OF! I wonder how the author gets published. It was terrible. I'd say don't waste your money but it was free, so don't waste your time. I won't waste my time on another one of her books.",0
"I was all set to like or to love this story. I've read and have really enjoyed other Lissa Matthews' stories, but this story is missing something for me. First of all, it ends at 88%, and it ends abruptly, in my opinion. As far as conclusions go, this one seems more like a big question mark. I even went to the next page, expecting more to be there, asking myself, is that it?It ends with really no firm HEA and no I love you. Now, if I'm not getting the I love you exchange between h/H, I definitely need for it to be implied, for the message to be intended by every other act or word leading to the ending. I need to have read the story so far with a clear idea of where both lead characters stand in the relationship. This relationship consisted of a one night stand, a meeting where h confronts H about his tendency to run away from anything meaningful or serious, and then one last night of sex. That's it. That's all they had.Of course I've read books with as little going on, but in those books I at least got strong emotion, conflicted feelings acted out, words depicting depth of love or wanting; I at least came away knowing what both characters meant to each other. Here, with this story, I can't tell you if they will stay together, if they love each other, if they need each other for more than just sexual gratification.It seems to me that h has found her strong, make-her-crawl Dom, and H has found his complete submissive, one who is a natural at it, in and out of bed. Other than that, what else can I tell you about them as a couple? I really don't know. That's how shallowly they are sketched out to me. These two characters have no distinct purpose and no strong motivation at all. They are almost like cardboard cut-outs, just nothing behind them but emptiness.This story had some hot scenes, but have I read hotter? Yes, and I've definitely read scenes with more depth of emotion. This is what's lacking to me: these love/sex scenes needed more meaning attached to them. Without showing me and letting me feel the connection between h/H, the author leaves me hanging, leaves me expecting more, wondering how things will be with these two down the road. In the very last paragraph, H tells h, 'You're more than just a f*** to me.' Oh wow, thanks for clearing that up.For me, this wasn't a fulfilling or satisfying read. You might get a brief sugar high from the sex, but you'll be let down and wishing you'd had something with a bit more substance to it instead.",0
I enjoyed the subtle way she wrote out the characters and pushed them into the story. Very well written. I look forward to seeing more of this writer. A MUST read.,1
Grace Livingston Hill always has a great story line. She was a wonderful author. I love the way she brings in the need for faith in  our lives.,1
This is a great book. I enjoyed the characters and the story line.  It was a good read and didn't require a lot of thought.,1
"I downloaded the book because I couldn't believe it was that bad.  It really didn't have much story line which is fine if the sex scenes are hot, but the erotic scenes did nothing for me.  I didn't hate the book, but it's not something I would ever read again.",0

"First you should know I could only finish half the book so maybe it got better.  The technical writing was very good and you did care about the characters.  However I could only read about the characters degradation for so long before I started to feel dirty.  Yes I understand that the life of a sex slave is not a pretty or kind one, but I think the writer was enjoying it a little to much.  Plus there was little to no back story so most of the drama and history that is referred to makes it feel like your missing a big part of the story or maybe that you started in on book 2 before finding the first one.",0
I love this series. All of them are interesting and makes me feel like the people are real and this is a town I would want to live in.,1
"Jules Kingston has always known that it would be her duty as her fathers' heir to become Lioness of her Pride - she just didn't know she would have to assume this position so soon.  Her fathers have decided to step down as Leos of the Pride and in doing so have made Jules' life a living Hell.  It is the tradition of her Pride to have two Leos and one Lioness in charge.  Much to Jules' dismay, when her fathers step down, every lion in the direct vicinity is sniffing after her trying to get her to mate, and she's tired of it.  Ready to run, Jules comes face to face with the two men who have no qualms about claiming their mate.Luke and Gabe Beckett knew three years ago that Jules was destined to be their mate and went to her fathers to cinch the deal.  Of course, Jules' fathers neglected to tell her that bit of information and when she finds out, she does exactly what they'd thought she'd do--she tries to run.  She doesn't get very far and when she's caught by Luke and Gabe, Jules is taken to their home and claimed.  The mating will come later once she accepts her position.  Time is not on their side, however, because Luke and Gabe aren't the only lions wanting Jules.  Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book!  I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home.  Jules' temperament often seemed off to me--I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her. But, despite that, I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions.  Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged.  It was a well written m&eacute;nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m&eacute;nage stories.  The ending was sublime, although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke, Jules, and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other.  However, that wasn't enough to keep me from reading another book by Paige McKellan.  She is on my radar now, and I can't wait to read more of her work!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
Short enough to read while your chili is cooking.  Keeps your interest from the beginning.

"Good writing, interesting plot, no meat and a LOT of swearing. I'm normally not a stickler for that type of thing, but Ms. Kramer seemed to go a little over the top with it in my opinion. It might have been better with more story line to break up the characters swearing at one another.",0
"This is one of those rare books that draws you in and keeps you, even if you don't normally read this type of story.  The writing is poetic, yet simple enough to not be confusing, nor overly flowery.This is the second book I've read by this author, and I have found it to be true for both so far.  I'd recommend getting any and all of his books that you can.Frankly, it's rare that I find a guy so able to write from a girl's perspective at times, and get it right.Thank you, and again...loved it.  :D",1

"I accidentally purchased this book, and frowned when I discovered I got a genre I normally do not read. I thought ""Yay me.....ex-cop chases down nemesis killer, kills him.. so much fun. But since I paid for it, I figured I would give it a try maybe it won't be so bad.What I found beside horrible kindle formatting was a book that drew you in with amazing details and descriptions, characters you grew understand and sympathize with, yes even the bad guys made you empathize with them. What intrigued me the most was that the heroine, Andrea, was almost bad enough to be the bad guy with her tormented past. I had never read a book that made me wonder if the good guy was going to go to the ""dark side"" but this one did. It left me guessing on the reasoning behind why Andrea was there.. to kill Clive or to join him. The small town of Twilight came alive inside my head the town people, back water Louisiana types took on a life of their own in the story.The book is ultimately about broken people, what leads them to be what they are and the choices they make to lead them into the future. It does contain graphic material on incest and child abuse, if you can't handle those subjects do not read this book as they are an intricate part of the story line.The story line was a slow dreamy pace that built up into a huge climatic ending that left you kind of sad but sated with how it ended. Thumbs up for this book from a person who usually runs the other direction from this type of story.",1
A very good story of the Breeds & the battles they must fight to keep the freedom they want & need.,1
"If you like old fashion, turn-of-the-century (19th to 20th) mystery novels you should  enjoy this collection of stories. As with most all of these types of detective stories, the main character is a bit eccentric. But nothing outlandish. The plots are good and the author has a way of keeping your interest. Should be enjoyable reading for most all mystery readers.",1
"If Terry Pratchett's Samuel Vimes and Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade ever had a love child, he would be finder Markhat. Sardonic, embittered, suspicious, but at heart a gentleman and an honorable ex-soldier, he expects the worst from everyone and brings out the best in many.Tuttle's world is very reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork. Very reminiscent - to the point where it bothered me quite a bit. Not only is there the same mix of fantasy and urban reality, you have Trolls playing a very large part in the story - and they're identical to Pratchett's trolls. Even the opening reminds one of the start of 'Guards, Guards'. The character names are very similar, as are the details of shops and the city and the river. Not identical, mind you, just a bit too close an imitation at times. As 'Dead Man's Rain, progresses, however, it finds its own unique voice and setting, and I stopped thinking this was Pratchett noir.'Dead Man's Rain' is a horror story and a narrative about venal instincts, greed and guilt. The set up is a little Maltese Falconish, and Markhat's weary cynicism is pure Spade as he deals with the snobby Widow Merlat and a incredible tales of ghosts and hauntings. But then, just as Tuttle sets you up thinking the plot will be resolved one way, he takes you down another. We learn more about Merlat's family, and her, and her servants, and Markhat reveals the qualities that kept him alive through a bitter and destructive war, in order to save the good and punish the wicked. This is not a romance - there's no pairing in this at all - and that's how it should be for our tarnished hero.Tuttle's writing is delightful, and even if he's borrowed some settings a little too heavily, Markhat's his own memorable creation, as are the plots and the dialogue. He's funny, in a very Bogartian sort of way, but like Pratchett, there's a deeper thread to his narrative than simple humour, with many a wry observation on human and non-human behaviour, populating his stories with vivid characters who continually surprise the reader.Really, there's nothing not to like here, if you like this genre, and aren't put off by the lack of romance. Finder Markhat is someone I want to read more about, and I hope Mr Tuttle revisits him.",1
This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.,1
"This short fell a little short of my expectations in regards to a twist on Romeo and Juliet and the feud between the families.  I don't know if this story would start a feud, but it would cut off the communications between the two families.

"I love Gothic Romances, especially paranormal ones, and not many are published anymore. So I was delighted to discover Touch Me in the Dark and read it with great pleasure. A spooky old Victorian, interesting characters, and a twisty story. For a different take, this story was set in an unusual place--Southern California--not where you'd expect to find a Gothic ghost story. But it works! Touch Me in the Dark is definitely worth reading!",1
"I must have not read the reviews on this carefully.  The beginning sounded interesting and the ending was ideal.  However, the rest - let's just say if you like nothing but total sex, then you will enjoy this book. Too much of a good thing can get boring. This was the case for me.",0

"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!

"okay I don't know what the other 2 reviewers read but what I read was really crap.  It was wrong on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. Set in a slightly dystopian future,  most of the world population is gone,  and the world is divided into masters and pets.  So far,  so interesting.  However,  we get Jiri,  who is male,  but is completely female in all his characteristics, you could make him a woman and only change the pronouns and it would still work (or not)  So Jiri is beautiful, fragile, feminine, virginal and his lover is obsessed with his inexperience and jealous of any experience he may or may not have - which is such an old virginal set up,  and surely we've outgrown it. Then the entire plot momentum is about misunderstandings, which just grew old fast,  and Jiri bringing his mother's influence and good manners to the camp, civilizing the rough men etc...This is a wall banger for me,  I wouldn't recommned it to anyone and will never read it again.",0

"Jodi Tyler is not at all happy with her boss and boyfriend Mark.  She's been hinting for weeks about how she wanted to spend her birthday evening - instead of celebrating she's sitting in a scorching hot van watching the estate that she's supposed to infiltrate.  On closer introspection she's afraid that he's planning on dumping her without having to say anything.  It wouldn't be the first time she was rejected in such a callous way.Mark Rodriquez has treated his relationship with Jodi as a casual situation.  They'd agreed that their relationship wouldn't be long term but breaking things off with her definitely isn't his intention.  Mark has an ulterior motive behind his instance that Jodi infiltrate the estate today but once his plans come to light he realizes that he might have made a huge mistake.  His feelings for Jodi are much stronger than he was willing to admit.Jodi's not at all worried about infiltrating the estate and cracking the safe.  She's very talented at what she does - and it's not like she's actually a criminal.  The whole thing is a set up to test the estate's security - or at least that's what she's been lead to believe.  Of course, Mark's complicated the whole thing a bit by introducing an adult toy into the equation.  Everything goes according to plan and she breaks into the safe in less than two minutes - just like she bet Mark she could - and then she gets busted.It seems Mark didn't forget her birthday after all.  He arranged for his friend Sam to catch Jodi at a critical moment and she's flabbergasted that such a thing could happen.  She makes the decision to level with her captor and give him the note that she was supposed to leave in the vault - only the note isn't what she believes it to be. It's the list of sexual fantasies that she'd written out for Mark and he's enlisted Sam's help to cross some of her fantasies off that list - and he'll definitely need help with number six, ""I'd like to have a m&eacute;nage with Mark and another man that we can trust.""Just when Jodi gets into the spirit of her birthday gift, Mark realizes that sharing HIS woman isn't something he really wants to do.  That's when Sam steps up and changes the rules just a bit.  Will Mark and Sam come out of this interlude on friendly terms and what about Mark and Jodi's romance? Will he still want her as his lover, or has that changed?Leah Braemel's PRIVATE PROPERTY delves into all of one woman's naughty fantasies and promises to leave readers hot and sweaty.  Mark and Jodi make a fantastic couple yet because they haven't shared their true feelings for each other there's a sense of insecurity which results in some very tense moments and an incredible sexual encounter.  All of these characters will touch your heart in one way or another.  Sam really captured my interest because he is so caring and insightful, yet there's something very lonely about him.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
This is my first book by Stephanie Bond.  I started reading this book at bedtime thinking I'll fall asleep after a few pages but she had me laughing so much I had to finish it in one read  - even if it meant staying up till 4AM.Thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
"I agree with the reviewer who asked why does every hero have to be a slut!!! It was like I could not STOP hearing about his blonde bimbos!!! She was of course, celibate for 8 years and he went through women like a child does candy!!! It was gross and made me believe that he did not have any love for the heroine. I am sick of writers making it look like a man only sleeps with women for a need to be fulfilled. That is not true. Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot! He also manipulated the heck out of a situation to get his way, harming the heroine and potentially harming the child if the press would have gotten worse. He did not think about anything but himself and his wants. He was NO HERO!!!!",0
"I like erotica well enough but this was billed more as erotic romance. There was nothing romantic about it. This is kind of sci fi as its set in the future a bit where there is an kind sex Olympics and sex is a talent that you can go to school to get good at. The world building in this book simply was not good. The hero was a Twit. I have no idea why the heroine would be in love with him.Most of all, it felt soulless.  And ick. Yep, ick. Not sexy.  I can't recommend even for those who like harder core erotica.I was given this book for my honest review. So, there you have it.",0
"Why would you not add a cook book to your Kindle??This book has more than just the basics, for example when you get a pizza recipe, you don't just get the standard oven pizza recipe, you also get explicit instructions and hints for making a grilled pizza.I am very pleasantly surprised by the number of illustrations that make this book even doubly helpful.I just made the Shepherd's Pie from this book last night and it was a huge hit.I made the cream scones for Sunday breakfast and they were heavenly.The really great thing is that you can bring this cook book with you and offer to make a meal as a weekend guest and all you have to do is throw in your Kindle not a big bulky book.",1
Good novel easy reading and a delight to read. Helped me to relax and dream easily.Would recommend to those who like Bianca's work.,1
The books sound like a great concept which would of been a very good book. The story is only a few pages then promotes other books to buy for rest.,0
"Ten years ago, a family was torn apart when a young wife and mother was murdered.  An investigation took place, but nobody was charged with the crime.  All these years, Dinah learned to put the past behind her.  But now Marc was back to get the answers of his wife's murder and clear himself because his thirteen year old son was asking questions.The action in this book was a bit snow for a suspense.  But the author shocked me.  I thought I knew who it was, but I didn't.The romance was non-existant until the very end.  I thought that was a bit unrealistic.The book was interesting enough though.",1
"This story started very well, and then it flailed in all directions.I think it was because it was setting the story up for sequels, but if I don't care any more for any of the characters or where they go in sequels by 2/3 into the book I'm not going to finish the book, and will never read any sequels.",0
"Feel like reading a light-weight story about a prancing, frolicking, materialistic, feather-headed stereotype of a gay man?  Well, stop the search here!The main character in this story is so undependable that he can't even search for a lost dog without getting distracted by a pretty set of wine glasses and so materialistic and trivial that he practically throws a temper tantrum when his partner expects him to drink coffee made from preground beans.This may be worth reading if you're a fan of the series that these characters apparently come from, but it's skippable for everybody else -- especially those of us who are used to gay men who act like actual humans and not designer-worshipping fluffheads.",0
The book did not flow well. Slow getting to the point and the authors attempt to make the characters sound Scottish was terrible. Don't waste your money on this one.,0
Not worth your time or money to read unless you feel need a Walt Disney ending. Story lacks heat and things become vanilla. Suddenly everyone is healed and wants normal relationships and lifestyles. Huge disappointment. Even their disagreements lack warmth.,0
"I bought this to read before I saw the movie.  It can be tedious because our language has changed so much.  The way the female characters are portrayed is indicative of the period in which the novels were written.  Of course the science is way off base buth then this was written long, long ago in another culture.",1
"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison, TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month, and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre.",1
"This was misleading.  They touted this book as being clean.  But, it had some sexual  content which is NOT clean.  I do not appreciate false advertising!",0
"I didn't realize this was such a short piece.I enjoyed it, however it felt like I was reading a random couple of chapters out of a book.",1
"I gave up 33% into the book.Everyone is too stupid. Everything is too much. In every way. The good guys are so good, so beautiful, so kind, so ... The bad guys are so evil, so dumb, so ... nothing seems in any way like it could be happening. It seems more like a caricature than anything else.The main character acts in a way that is incomprehensible. He is - supposedly - smart. He makes choices, give promises, acts in a way I would not expect an idiot to do. I am supposed to cheer for this unlikable idiot?I don't buy the scenario, the characters or the story.What made me give up?Well the really really bad guys that are yankee stupid morons go invade the world of the really really beautiful liberal wonderfully amazingly beautiful people. In order to kill all the men and make all the women slaves since they are a 'natural resource'. I am staring at a sentence here where it says they would be ""little more than slaves"", while the stated goal is to make them slaves. I can't read something this inconsistent.On the positive? I would say the author writes well. Normally that would save it from 1 star, but not this time.",0
"I downloaded this after I read ""Veiled Eyes"" which I thought was pretty good. Obviously this is one of her early works. The first few pages read like a story outline. The author tries to cram tons of backstory into a few paragraphs, which is unsatisfying to a reader. I'd much rather the story unfold as I read rather than be told the cliff notes version up front. And then there's the so-called romance. It basically is along the lines of, ""we're both gorgeous, so Tab A must fit into Slot B"". No build-up or getting to know the characters before they're getting it on because they're passionately in something. Right after he just saved her from dying because of bodily injury. I don't care how much magic's involved, you don't get up from your deathbed to roll in the hay, especially if you think the bad guys might still be on your trail. On top of that add really unique (not in a good way) descriptive words and phrases. At least it was short. The other two stories which follow are actually much better, so if you like paranormal romance that involves people who are tall, dark and furry I would go ahead and read it. But literature it ain't.",0
I almost cried when I reached the end me want more....so now i guess i am a fan of ms dom adair,1
Great read!  Not for the weak of heart.  Good story line with a little kick.  Would recommend reading this book!,1
"Amazon assures me this is a full-length novel but since I read it in one sitting, I'm having trouble accepting their word for it. That aside, it did move very quickly and it's a lot of fun, especially if you can keep track of where everybody is and what they're doing. There's no real depth to the characters but hey, it's a comedy, they don't have to be deep to be funny.The book could use another proofreading pass, but if you can get past the spelling, grammar, etc., then it's worth some time. Normally I'd knock a half-star or full star off for the errors, but it did keep me up reading pretty late. So we'll call this one a full four stars.",1
"Action filled, passion filled with a funky twist.  The fantasy of it all was intriguing to say the least.  All in all a good read.",1
"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",1
"My Review:Mya has worked with Milo at an advertising agency, competed with him for accounts,  and been his friend for five years. They started out in Atlanta, but when she realized she was falling in love with him, she decided it was time for a change and headed to the Mirage Agency in DC. Shortly thereafter, Milo was offered a job at the same agency and he accepted the offer and now they are working together again, which is slowly driving Mya insane as she is lusting after him. What she doesn't realize, is that Milo is having the same issues.The tension culminates to a head when the two place a highly sexual bet over an account which results in a weekend full of incredible passion. Milo is trying to figure out how to expand the weekend into much more, but Mya doesn't realize where his head is, and is worried about losing her heart and her friend.This is a hot little book with tons of really passionate loving. These two are best friends, but neither one realizes what the other is thinking which created the tension for the book. I like that they have a highly competitive relationship at work. I thought that it added an interesting element to the story. There was an interesting twist at the end that I really enjoyed with their careers, which I didn't see coming. I also really liked what Andre added to the story and LOVE that his story is next.If you are looking for a hot little read, this is a good one.",1
You get a really good glimpse into Z and Bella's life/ story/ relationship in this novella. Really sweet and a great addition to the BDB series.,1

"A little bit more sex than story, Bound for the Holidays by Mackenzie McKade is a hot read. Quick and flirty, this book is as difficult to pass up as Angie's invitation to spend the night with her boss. Mentions of family ground both main characters but really it's a simple story of the beginning of their relationship. By the end, I wish I could've known more but as it is, I enjoyed Angie and Ryan's story.Already resigned to spending Christmas alone, Angie cannot believe it when she finds herself in the arms of her new boss at the office party. Their attraction is hot and his promises of things to come set her on fire. And then when she finds herself with not just one, but two gorgeous men - a powerful executive and one sexy cowboy - her holiday wishes are fulfilled.Ryan has never considered not sharing his women with his best friend Wade so it was only natural to introduce him to Angie. But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning. Regardless, I liked the characters and found myself looking for the second book in the series to see if Wade gets his HEA.RATING: 4 Chocolate-dipped Strawberries - originally posted for Guilty Indulgence reviews[...]",1
"Dan is 3/8 Indian and, while seemingly unbelieving, has sleeping and occasional waking dreams, as had his mother, of coyote's the trickster and shape shifters. These are like barely heard background noises.  His wife had died of cancer a year ago, his bright beautiful daughter is off to work and to summer school.  He had grown up in the four corners area and in the service had done intelligence work, he is retired and is now a high school math teacher on his way to teaching summer classes after dropping his daughter off.A niece calls while he is traveling and begs for help, her husband is hiding in the desert accused of a murder he says he did not commit and she wants Dan to investigate.  He did not think a lot of her husband and going ""home"" brought back memories.  His parents had disappeared mysteriously many years ago and his older brother was killed in an auto accident about 18 years ago.He can defend himself, but this is not an action adventure hero who mops up the bad guys with a flurry of kicks and shot gun blasts. He stays in shape but is not a combat robot, he thinks and analyses and follows clues and once engaged is very persistent.  He pulls the threads of a tangled web spun by a loose conspiracy of men who have and seek power and riches above all, letting no one (least of all family) get in their way.  An interesting hero and a good tale.  I look forward to reading other books.",1
"I usually read reviews before purchasing a book (even before downloading free ones) for just this reason. However, I was in a hurry, liked the blurb and downloaded it. Thank goodness it was free or I'd be screaming for my money back. This book is complete waste of time if you expect an ending and I do. It's very confusing in places. You don't know if what is happening is real, a hallucination, or a dream sequence as one flows into the other without any transition. I won't say it didn't have any good parts, because it did. Had it actually ended satisfactorily I probably would have given it 3 stars. However, this is NOT A STANDALONE book. It just ends in the middle of everything with a ""to be continued."" What the heck? I am so tired of authors thinking they can force you to buy their next book by not giving the first one an ending. All this does is tick me off for wasting my time. Had it been a good book, with a real ending and stood alone, I would have purchased the next in the series. I usually do. What this author has done has made me add him to my black list of NEVER TO BUY AGAIN authors. I will never trust this author (or anyone else who does this) to provide an enjoyable reading experience. If it's intended to be a serial with no conclusion of each book then the author needs to state that in the description. Just saying Book One doesn't cut it. There are great series of books out there that each have their own ending.",0
"AND all the fantastic characters that she creates!  Having the whole Trilogy in one to read was great too, I hate having to wait for individual story continuations to come out!  I highly recommend any and everything that she writes!",1
"(SPOILERS AHEAD) I must confess to a soft spot regarding stories about childhood sweethearts reunited as adults (""One day"" for ex.) which is why I bought this book despite some doubts. And the beginning is pretty good.But... It was oh-so-predictable and cliche, the boy insisting for the girl's virginity, the local blond vamp-tramp miss popular stealing him...Also, I didn't buy into the love story. This is infatuation. All the characters seem able to do is to make one another miserable. It reminded me of ""Twilight"" with wanting to shout ""get a grip!"" to the girl every other page.(But don't get me wrong, I liked ""Twilight"" and thought it was a lot better!)All in all, I felt the book ""scratched"" the surface of possibilities, both plot and character development, without really taking off.",0
"First and foremost, I'd just like to point out that this is actually a good book but ultimately the open-relationship Zach allowed Angelo to have killed my enjoyment of the story. I'm not saying I judge their relationship, I just don't understand it and I don't want to read about it. If you like reading about all that and if you don't mind open-relationships, that's cool, but I prefer monogamous relationships over anything else and that's that. :-/It was great getting another installment of the guys, though. In the past, Angelo was my favorite character but, unfortunately, he's not anymore. He's actually my least favorite now and Matt is firmly at the top. Anyways, I liked the fact that we got to see Matt get a little more intimate with Jared in public (there's only a brief scene but still, it was sweet) and I liked the fact that Zach and Angelo get closer through their little 'kink'. It was nice how everything worked out in the end even if it wasn't the way I'd like it to have ended.I will say that I thought Angelo was a freaking hypocrite the way Zach let him fool around with other guys but he wouldn't let Zach do the same. And I also thought it was way out of character for Angelo to do that since in A to Z he was pretty gaga over Zach and didn't give any indication that he'd do something like that but that's just my opinion. At the beginning, I thought Angelo was walking all over Zach but it's clear by the end that Zach actually gets turned on by Angelo dancing with other guys and knowing that by the end of the day, Angelo will always be his. Still don't understand it but all power to them, right?I liked seeing pieces of Angelo's old personality and how he could pretty much lose anyone with how he just goes off topic and then back on it again. There was also brief spurts of humor I rather enjoyed and I especially enjoyed getting back into Matt's head again.All in all, I think this would have been a great book if the whole conflict of Zach and Angelo's sexual life would have been left out but that's just my opinion and because of that, I can't recommend this book. Sorry :-/",0
"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.

Jane and her business partner Lily own a party planning business called R.S.V.P., and Lily and Dirk, Antonio's brother, planned this birthday celebration for Antonio. It's a mascaraed/BDSM weekend where the invited guests stay at the estate for a fun filled party experience. So all guests are wearing partial masks, so every one is held in secrecy and anything you do or don't do is kept private by your mask. During the intro performance Jane is getting highly aroused, and Antonio walks up behind her and starts whispering suggestive things in her ear.

"I always debate writing a review and scoring a book I don't finish, but to be fair, I ought to say why I didn't like the book.  I usually like McKenna's stories.  This story, however, was just not that good.  The dialogue was a bit unbelievable, the characters  didn't make sense to me.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good, well thought out, well told story.  This just didn't meet any of that criteria for me.We're supposed to believe that Max, as a PI successful enough to hire employees for his PI/security firm, instead of following the subject of his investigation follows instead the teacher of a dance class that he found attractive.  While he follows her we get this constant stream of his inner dialogue, which I didn't find to be very humorous or enlightening.  It was just annoying.Jordan, the subject of Max's stalking, goes to a bar with some students from her dance class.  See's Max, gathers up her courage to hit on him, and then let's him feel her up on the dance floor and promptly takes him to her house.... Really??  Later that night, after a bit of trouble at her house, she's upset he didn't tell her that he was in security.  Um... when was he supposed to tell her?...  when he had his tongue down her throat or during sex?In the first half of the book there was nothing likable about the characters.  Max comes off as a stalker, who you question how he ever gained the skill or discipline to be the owner of a successful PI/security firm.  Jordan comes off as unreasonable and paranoid. Overall, that gives me no reason to read further, neither character were likable or relate-able.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a far fetched story, but the characters, and their actions, should make sense within the context of that story.Now, don't think I have high expectations for Shakespearean-like story telling for every author I read.  I really don't.  I just expect a good story.",0
Great series. would like to see more of this one. could incorporate the werewolves next....,1
"I've read several of Glenn's books over several series. Before reading this volume, I had read every other volume of this series (except the newest 1, vol. 7; it had not been published when I finished reading the other 5). I had not read this one, because I didn't think the books needed to be read in sequence and the summary for this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read it. Since I thought 7 costs more than what I wanted to pay, and I'd been waiting for several months, a year at least I think, for her to finish the series, because vol. 6 actually ended with a cliff hanger - I decided to just go ahead and read this volume for the sake of completion, in the mean time while waiting for the price of vol. 7 to lower, if it lowers.Well after reading vol. 1, I wish that I hadn't, but I'd been curious about how Jake and Lucas got together with Leyland, because all the others manage to refer to their relationship and the 'incident' that they had with Leyland where he almost died, at least once. Since the first vol. of the series, that I did read, explained the issue with the tri-omegas having to find their 2nd mate, once they found the first, I could deduce why or how it was the Leyland nearly died from being grounded to his room for several days. Therefore, I didn't think that the actual circumstances that led to the grounding, but just what nearly happened as a result of the grounding, was pertinent to the plots of the other volumes. In conclusion, I didn't need to read it to fully understand any of the vols. that I did read, if I didn't want to.I tried to like Secret Desires, after one read, but I just couldn't, not enough to want to keep it or suggest it to anyone else. I liked it from the very beginning, when no one other than Leyland had been introduced. I found it amusing, but then Jake was introduced, but not Lucas. And I started to wonder why Jake greeted Leyland alone without Lucas. I knew that Jake and Lucas had been together 10 years for the summary. I assumed that the summary meant mated. It didn't. And when I figured that out, I got rather disappointed with the story. I couldn't understand how Jake and Lucas after being in love with and sleeping with one another and sharing a bedroom for TEN YEARS, didn't realize that one another was mates, despite the fact that they really, really didn't believe two men could be mated, if after seeing - not touching or actually meeting - but just seeing Leyland ONCE, only once, Jake knew without a doubt that Leyland was definitely his mate, since Leyland was ALSO A MAN. I'm not sure how the author didn't see that glaring contradiction in her own work. A good friend of mine, suggested that it's probably due to not having an editor, because that's the sort of things editors catch and bring to the author's attention, before she publishes a work.The three of them Jake, Luc and Ley got things sorted rather quickly and that was good.The gaping contradiction, was just too hard for me to ignore, and that's the not so good part. Now if you have read any of the others, like vol. 2 and 3 which have the same contradiction and 4, which is the exact opposite, where the two regular wolves are mated before they meet the tri-omega and then one of them recognized the tri-omega as his mate upon the first time he met him, but the other didn't. (The 2nd one was drunk, and furious due to major jealously at the time, plus tired and sleepy, so maybe that was his excuse. Can't say, because the author never explains.) I was able to let it slide in the 2 and 3, because, in those cases, the tri-omegas 2 mates had not met and been involved before meeting him. Instead, one met the tri-omega first and got involved and then the two of them both met the third and pretty much the same time and together. So it was easier to ignore.I just couldn't get over how Jake could drop the love of his life for 10 years, for someone he'd never actually met, and then have sex with the guy - Leyland - on the way back to the house that he shared with said long-time lover. Really?!! And then when Jake and Leyland get to the house, and Lucas realizes that Leyland is his mate too, Jake immediately doesn't want to share. So first, he breaks up with Lucas, taking himself as a lover from Luc and two, when he learns that Luc actually has a fated mate, same as he does, because it just happens to be his also, he doesn't want Luc to claim the guy right away, like he just did, until HE can figure things out. So while Jake has everything including something he's always dreamed of, but never thought would happen - his fated mate,Leyland, plus Luc pining over him, poor Luc, on the other hand, has NO ONE and nothing, just immense, nearly unbearable pain and suffering, while 'Jake' figures things out. And to add insult to injury, Jake gets to have his mate 'while' he figures thing out and Luc gets to live in the same house and watch and listen to the man that he loves 'and' his mate, be with one another while he's alone and can't be with either, nor even claim his mate, Leyland, whom he has just as much right to as Jake dose - while 'Jake' figures things out.  I liked Jake; he seemed to be a good guy for the most part, but I thought in his excitement of having a mate and his rush to claim him, Jake's behavior toward Luc, the man he'd loved for 10 years, was greedy, selfish and insensitive. I don't think finding his fated mate, was a good enough reason for him to just go off and claim the guy in the way that he did, with the sex, before giving poor Luc any chance to even try to adjust. Haven't they heard of dating!! He could have just tried to get to know Leyland first, for awhile without him even being at the house or living there at least, without claiming him, while giving Luc some time to try and wrap his mind around the whole thing. But no, after only being broke up for only a few weeks, not even a month, he moves another man - fated mate or not - into the room that he had shared with Luc while Luc is still living in the same house! Really?! That was awful!!!! In my opinion it was. Fate or not, there is a right way and a wrong way to do a thing. And that was not right way. To me the author comes across saying that their love for anyone else, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, when compared to being with their fated mate. Yes, everything worked out in the end, but neither Jake and especially not Luc knew that.Jake gets his mate, great and wonderful, and Luc just gets shafted and not in the good way. And Jake couldn't find a way to be more sensitive about it. I don't see that a fated mate allows them to just disregard someone that hey are currently involved with.I had wondered what one of them, a shifter, would do in a situation like that where, he/she met their mate, but was already in loving monogomous relationship with someone, that he/she had been with for a long time, at the time.  When I finally read an example, though, - I really didn't like it! Well sometimes, that's how it is.Yeah, I know it's fantasy, but I take love very seriously. So I don't like it, when a character in a story, is supposed to be the good-guy or the protagonist, and just treats someone they love horribly for any reason, other than to save a person's life or to like save the world (family, town, country, universe, space and time and we know it) or something of that nature.",0
"I bought the next book before I read this short story, I hope it's better because I am a stickler for details and already had issues with this first chapter. Small things but irritating to me, like""Steel balls"" coming from a shotgun (they're lead)And when she got into her ""Ford Blazer""..... (Chevy Blazer)It just sounds Iike a 12 year old writing when small details are wrong.",0
Dr. Thorndyke is truely a fantastic legal eagle combined with a medical doctor. All his cases are in the early 1900s when they were written and the author uses logic and science to prove his theories. I truely believe Freeman was writing about the first Forensic Scientist when he created Dr. Thorndyke.,1
"Not your average everyday christmas miracle but one to remember none-the-less. Hot hot hot hotel room scenes. One even included a lil bit ol bondage & a gag.Nick and Holly meet in a gentleman's club which is actually a Christmas themed strip club. Holly has a normal boring job as an accountant but her best friend convinces her to fill in as Mistress Christmas. So this shy sexy account slowly burst out of her shell with a couple courage shots and embraces a wild side.Detective Nick West is at the club hoping to catch Mistress Christmas in the act...of stealing from her male customers. One look at Holly aka Mistress Christmas and he is hooked. He soon gets a lap dance he won't soon forget and just knows that he is far from done with Holly.Personally I prefer the authors other series spotlighting on the McKays but this was a great break from them and it was nice to read about a West boy. The Wests boys are cousins to the wild McKay bunch. It even made reference back to a couple of the McKay boys so if you've read the Rough Rider Series you'll enjoy that.This was actually an ebook from my local library that I got from an Amazon loan..so can't beat that. Was a quick, hot read that I did enjoy. I don't know if I connected with the characters like in the RR but overall still good.",1
"As the candies in the title, this romance is sweet like sugar.Peter is a big pastry chef, he is at the top in every competition, but always second. He is again competing at a national level and again he has as an assistant Josh. Josh is a young chef who looks with starry eyes upon Peter: for Josh everything Peter creates is perfect, and when Peter loses, for Josh is almost a personal matter. Obviously Josh is in love with Peter but he has never had the courage to make a move on Peter, both since he doesn't judge himself worthy of the love of wonderguy Peter, and because he really doesn't know if Peter is gay, since the man never express an interest in him, other than for work.But this time Peter seems a bit more interested in Josh as a man than in Josh as a pastry assistant...The story is short, less than 40 pages, but really really sweet. I like above all the fact that Peter is really not a special guy, maybe he is even a bit overweight, and he is really a sweet guy; but for the loving eyes of Josh he is wonderful.",1
"I first read this story a while ago.  Just recently, I finished reading the second book of the series and it made me want to read this story again.  While each book could stand on its own, the second installment of the series followed a believable progression.I am looking forward to the last book in the series.Would recommend this book (and series) to anyone who enjoys science fiction.",1
I was there. I was totally there and hooked in with the dancing and whatever. It started out hot for me and then it felt like the book was moving through mud and I didn't have the patience to work through the slow parts to get to the good parts.,0
"I am an author and have had the honor of being featured on one of the Kindle Nations sponsorship programs. This opportunity has helped me connect with readers, who have become interested in my book, and at the same time, I found many new authors and ebooks for my own reading pleasure. This program and blog is a great opportunity for readers and writers of ebooks! Thanks Stephen!",1
"This case is very well made and I'm sure it'll last a long time. I agree with one of the other reviewers that they should have made the ""leather"" cover the entire screen of the DX, not just 3/4 of the screen. I disagree with another reviewer who said that the case is 1/2 inch too big in length and width- it fits the DX almost perfectly, and the DX does not slide around inside the case.I put the word 'leather' in quotes above because Amazon advertises it as being made of ""high-quality leather,"" but the manufacturer's tag says ""faux leather."" Amazon should not be charging $45 for a case made with faux leather. I'm keeping it because it protects the DX better than any other case available, but the price Amazon is charging is more than the case is worth.",1
For fantasy lovers tired of the same old story re - done with a diff cover this story takes a break down a diff path.Enjoyable read i would recomend to anybody.,1
The Mysterious Island is the 1st time I have read Jules Verne. Of course I've known about him all my years alive since my teenage years and have to say I really did enjoy this book which I downloaded free from Amazon for my Kindle being one of the classics that it is. Jules Verne was a very remarkable intelligent thoughtful writer. I definitely will be reading more of his works.,1
"Since her father's death, Penny's been plagued by troubles on the ranch and sinister characters have been lurking about, and though she doesn't like the idea much, she feels she has no choice but to send for a mail order husband, dreaming of a knight in shining armor coming to right all her problems, despite her professed pessimism regarding the scheme. Penny and Jace were such engaging characters, making great equal partners when it was called for, but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong, protective man at other times, and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted. I'm glad it all worked out in the end, but I wish things could have been resolved a bit sooner. The humorous bits sprinkled throughout the story were great!",1
"Described as ""a collection of short stories told from a different character's involvement and point of view,"" this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter. None of it was particularly great. Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball, with almost no background, engaging characterizations, or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago, and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it, entitled Soul. I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a ""Prequel companion"", and it's not exactly that, as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion, having now read two novels and two ""short story collections"" (one of which actually was a short story collection!) by Farrell, as well as the first chapter of Soul, perhaps Farrell should stick to novels. The longer format provides the obviously-needed room to develop interesting characters. One Night with the Fae lacks in this area, and pretty much reads like an author's outline for a longer work.",0

Unfortunately the trip to Hawaii is all business.  Justin has hopes of it becoming more, and after reading one of Amy's emails, he knows that Amy isn't quite the ice princess she pretends to be.  Can Justin get Amy to loosen up enough to let him into her life?  Can Amy let herself relax enough to have all her dreams come true?Unwrapped is WONDERFUL!  From start to finish Jaci Burton had my attention.  This book is HOT.  I will warn you, this book does have a m&eacute;nage scene, but it isn't what the whole book is about.The struggle Amy has between her job and her personal life are very real to life and Ms. Burton did a wonderful job pulling me into the story.

"Jenny Penn is usually an automatic read for me.  KANSAS HEAT, however, might have changed my mind.You have Amanda and her three men -- Knox, Cody, and Jace.  These three men did their best to offer her comfort, security, and love.  And what did they get in return? Amanda was horrible.  She was unlikeable, selfish, and whiney. Her personality, or lack thereof, ruined KANSAS HEAT for me.  I wanted all three of these men to find someone else -- anyone else but her.  She didn't deserve them in the least.Hopefully Ms. Penn's next book will be better because goodness knows this one made me tear my hair out.Natalie S.",0
"This was a pretty good short story.I found myself laughing and yelling at the book during different scenes. I love 'take charge, sexually aggressive men' and Milo is it. I couldn't help but wonder if Maya truly deserved him. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, but I will say that its the typical office romance where mis-communication causes people to act like fools. Although the story was mighty short, I was still entertained. And, the sex scenes were great. Who doesn't like those uninhibited, freeing, honest sexual experiences? Good god... I remember being reckless. LOL Anywayyy... it's a fun, fast read. So, for less than $2, you can't go wrong.",1
"It was written well, though it could have been written better.But if your going to slap out a cereal box story, you might as well make it as quick as possible.I didn't take long to get through it, and that was a plus. I'm cool with the whole shape shiftier idea, but the deputy with a crush was a big of a dragging point for me. Which is funny to say, sense the guy in the story was the most interesting part to read.This story was alright, but is not memorable, so it scores no bragging rights from me.",0
Loved the series of Atlanta Westmorelands now it is time to get acquainted with the Denver clan. I can't wait!,1
"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book, I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that, however, was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book, things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys, other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States, and, the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who, in this instance, are prepared to be generous.",0

"I stumbled across this book and thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. Some parts kind of dragged on but I'm glad I stuck with it. It was nice to see Adam changing his ways throughout the book. You knew he was really in love with Peter and could tell when he started realizing it in the story. Though he never says it, you just know. Anyway, great book. I enjoyed it. Now onto No Rest for the Wicked.",1
"This is the third book in the Tom Caton series, and I am giving it a rest.  I have the same complaints that I had previously - wooden Kate, semi-one dimensional Caton, sophomoric love scenes, lack of tension.  This time out, since the locale was largely in China, the appealing Manchester took a back seat.  I usually don't read the book synopsis since spoilers lurk, but this time, I would have been well-served.  While human trafficking is deplorable and a reality, my interest flagged from the start.  Details followed details about the Triad, the Tong, and no suspense built at all.  I found no one to root for, no one to despise, since the characters were thrown out there with no real feeling to them.  I'm sorry to give this series a miss since there are five more....  I am usually enthralled with continuing characters and thrilled to have a long series.  Not this time.  So many like Susan Hill, Cynthia Harrod-Eagles, Alex Gray have created suspenseful stories and endearing characters who just get better and better, I had hoped for the same.  Alas, not so.  Maybe you do get what you pay for:)",0

"Rainy Clarke, an independent young woman fills out a form with the Government department which arranges marriages, confident that the government can do a better job than she can in choosing partner. Everything seems right - a fabulously wealthy member of the jet set and a long standing member of a ""top"" family, goodlooking - what can possibly go wrong with this match? Well, too much drinking and shallow behaviour for a start. The heroine is weak and a bit silly and the characters too stereotyped.I thought I would enjoy this unusual plot which of course ended traditionally in spite of the author's effort to make it different, but unfortunately it was a bit of an effort to get through it.",0
R.G. Alexander is becoming one of my favorite addictions. The way the characters are woven together between this book and Not in Kansas makes the set hard to put down. It is definitely on my will read again list.,1
"I got this as a free download,  and usually score them more generously,  but even free,  something's are not worth my time... I have to finish the book to give it 3 stars,  and I didn't,  so it gets 2.  5495 locations.Jim Richards is 60 years old, has only one friend and drinks 6 beers a night (he prefers to drink 8 but he's unemployed now) and he also lives with his parents, but they didn't seem to have much personality or input.  But it wasn't his character so much as the simple way that the story was told that lost me.  When pondering on who the killer might be Jim thinks: ""Honestly,  I wouldn't know what a killer even looked like.  All my crime books left that to my imagination.  On TV, they were the last person you would suspect, not very outstanding looking"" - and that's about the level of all the writing.  It was too banal and I wasn't engaged.  I let it go.Edited to add - I immediately received a very curt comment from the author and looking at the other reviews,  I can see a trend of bullying of any negative reviews,  which puts me off the entire matter.  I would never read anything by Bob Coates again... Bob Coates has since deleted his comment,  but the issue of his rudeness and attempts of intimidation are still true and I will keep this review up.",0
"I hate that it seems that all I am doing lately is writing a bad review.  I guess when you read the quantities I do, you are bound to hit as many bad books as you do good books. That was stale. There was no real story, the characters were just names on a page. Gosh that sounds harsh but for me, it's true. I'm glad I didn't buy the rest n this series. Oh, and I HATE the artwork on the books in this series.  Sorry!",0
"This book started out so good, hot guy chasing his destined mate. Hot sex too, I was way into it, then it fell like a souffl&eacute;.I don't know if it was the lack of action, or just the main guy being a wimp, but I got tired of the book. I didn't care if the characters got together or not. I wasn't excited to see where the story went, I just wanted the story to be over and the book done.Also how many people can see their best friend getting bitten and then just accept that vampire exist within five minutes.",0
"There are, perhaps, a few places where the characters' past history and current personalities might not stand up to close scrutiny -- but the turns of phrase are quite deft, and the characters are simply _fun,_ so I'm not inclined to quibble. The faintest besmirching of the overall entertainment is a duel which has a slight jump and feel of ""insert duel here"" in the author's notes, but that's the only part which got my mind hiccuping.The other reviews cover details quite well enough, and the bits that I really, really liked, I can't say or it'll spoil the snickers. (There is quite a fair dose of humor here and there!) Unfortunately, the first of those is just _after_ the sample text ends.",1
"I delete very few books from my library, but this will be one of them. Don't frustrate yourself by reading this book unless you are into masochism.",0

Love shifter stories and i really liked this one.  What's not to like? Homely girl gets the super hot guy and pisses off the local diva.  Great stuff.  The only thing is that the ending was rushed and the story was too short.,1
"I like shifter alien romance stories with a dominate male and a strong, but submissive female This story had it all, including hot sex scenes and a little intrigue, plus the promise of more to come in future books.",1
"A good erotica with very descriptive scenes, but as far as plot goes, there wasn't much happening. The characters weren't very relatable to me and I found myself growing slightly bored with the repetition in the intimacy between Cole and Tess. Just wasn't the book for me.",0
Did enjoy this book even though it was so very similar to a previous book by the same author. Very clean though.,1
"Oh boy.  I downloaded this little gem and read it out of boredom this last weekend.  I was kind of surprised by the content, it wasn't what I was expecting, especially based on the story description and what it left out (sex in shifted form infers both partners are shifted, and that rape is not involved, at least to me).Raise your hand if you find bestiality, coercive relationships, pseudo-incest (not technically incest but still psychologically traumatizing) and rape, sexy?  If that's you, you're gonna love this story.  Well actually, you might not, because it's really not all that well thought out or written.As a child growing up, Rachael knows her family is different.  They are Amon-Kai, a race of beings of which little is known or told to the reader.  We only know that they have pale green eyes and can see really well in the dark.  Also the males have special abilities and grow to a very large size, and as well, turn into murderous beasts every full moon; that is unless they find their perfect mate, and bond her to him (and while I'm at it, what is with all of this bonding forever crap?  She writes about it in every story, where the woman must be ""bonded"" to the male, permanently.  As tempting as it is to go into a rant about the myth of monogamy (as in one partner and one partner only, for life) and how sick I am of seeing this stupid-ass trope, I'll refrain. ) Then they are saved from their curse.  Rachael's older foster brother, Richard, is also Amon-Kai.  And conveniently, his perfect mate also happens to be his sister.  However, the children's mother is disgusted by the thought of her daughter being forced into a nasty, coercive relationship in which her daughter will have no agency and her son will be allowed to sneak into his sister's room at night and molest her, after she comes of age.  After a fight with her husband, she kidnaps her daughter and they move to a land far away.  Sort of.  Years later, Rachael has moved on with her life and gave up looking for Richard years prior.  Guess she didn't have the all consuming desire for him that he had for her...yet another bad sign.  However, it isn't long before Richard shows up, having finally found her, since he never stopped looking to begin with.As adults, Rachael is engaged to another man who is portrayed in classic Evangeline fashion as weak, smarmy, somewhat effeminate, and up to no good.  No doubt Elise's ""fianc&eacute;"" , referenced in her last book, Revealed and who will surely play a part  in her upcoming book Persued, will be shown in the same unflattering light.  It would be a problem bigger than Anderson could ever handle or write about should the fianc&eacute; be an okay dude.  She simply doesn't know how to bring a couple together without coercion or a bad situation that forces them together, or making ""the other man"" or ""the other woman"" bad people so that the good ones will want to get together.  Like a man who turns into a murderous monster every full moon, and MUST have bonding sex with the woman he knows belongs to him (who cares what she thinks about that) to calm him down.  Not cool.  I would love for her to prove me wrong.  The only reason I bother reading any stories of hers are that I've always seen a spark of something special with her writing.  But I digress; further along in the story, there is a scene in which Richard in his beast form, rapes Rachael, who sacrifices herself in order to prevent him from eating her friend who is unconscious.  This scene was sickening and completely unsexy.  I nearly stopped reading there.  This is the second book of Anderson's that I've read, in which a woman who technically consents but is repulsed by the actual act happening the entire time and tries to leave the hero after because of it.  If that's not rape, then it's something else that's just about as nasty. Just because her body reacted to it, does not make it any less rape.  It really troubles me that Anderson uses that in her stories to justify the male's actions (for example, her men often say things like ""you may say otherwise but your body doesn't lie"" in dubious consent/rape scenes.  It kind of scares me a little that her writing seems to infer that a woman becoming wet during rape, means that she actually wants it.) After this happens, Rachael attempts to cut Richard off and marry her fiance, only to have him show up on her wedding day and seduce her.  Slowly she gives into the needs of her body and realizes within the last two pages that THIS IS WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS.  Right?That the hero would want to force this situation on the heroine, struck me as rather unloving and very very selfish.  It made me dislike him as a person.  If he really cared and wanted her to be happy, he'd leave  her alone.  Or at least quit dressing up their relationship in romantic BS language when this story is about as romantic and sexy as watching a girl get raped by a dog.  But, then again, YMMV.",0
I enjoyed the character development especially the bias kept between the father and his son. The fathers lack of understanding of his sons sexual preferences is so true to life that many elderly still express. Especially folks over seventy.,1
"This sequel to ""Hiding the Elephant"" is in desperate need of an editor. The  number of grammatical/spelling errors, typos and plain old misuse of words was abysmal.The story wanders all over the place with characters popping up, disappearing and then reappearing much later.Thank heavens for the ""search"" feature.I don't have any idea if the author ever reads these critiques, but if so I would chastise her for letting errors such as the following ever make it into print:Whishing for wishing (three times!), style for stile, flack for flak, neigh for nigh, dogged for dodging bullets, "" hey-fever,"" pluming for plumbing, desert for dessert, a smooth loan for lawn, loped for lopped, looser for loser, ""chentrelle, cep and morelle""  for chanterelles, cepes and morels, ad infinitum...truly depressing that such a poorly edited book would ever make it into the market.The story itself has so many branches that the reader gets lost or ends up not really caring who did it. The infidelity theme carried over from the first book did almost nothing to further the story line.For the sake of literate readers of murder mysteries, please, please do not subject us further to this kind of horribly edited verbiage..",0
"Delightful, refreshing reading -- nothing lurid, just relaxing reading. Written in a time different than today, but still fascinating in its simplicity.",1
"I don't know what others read (those who gave it a high rating) but I definitely didn't read that book. My book was confusing. It's like you have to start with book one. So my suggestion is that it only be sold as a group because you can't pick up one and follow the story. I don't like to read a book and it's like I just joined a conversation and I don't know what the heck we're talking about or why.Now this is just my opinion but I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. It took me forever and three more years to finish. Therefore it gets a no, no, and heck fire NO rating.By the way, I've read other books by this author and I've enjoyed them. But I definitely did not enjoy ""A Lover's Worth - Ramsey V"".",0
"After serious contemplation, my opinion is that sensitive readers may want to take a pass on this uneven and, in places, somewhat unpleasant book.Part of the problem is the subject matter, part is the uneven writing, and part is the character of Homicide Inspector John Richetti, a highly-stressed hard-drinking policeman who was caught up in the Jonestown cult as a child in the `70s -- the one where 900 people drank the Kool-Aid.At times, Richetti is so dimwitted and irresponsible that even his undercover partner calls him a ""stupid bastard."" Here's one example: He gives seven sleeping pills -- seven! -- to a cult member not used to taking them (this isn't a bad guy) and the person almost doesn't wake up. Here's another: Despite being specifically warned not to tell the truth because admitting personal weaknesses lets the cult get their hooks into you, he openly admits his involvement at Jamestown. He always knows best and he's always wrong.In fact, neither of the investigators, Richetti or Marilyn Michaelsen, the police department psychologist who accompanies him under cover, is up to the task -- the supremely dangerous job of infiltrating the Earthbound cult and bringing two suspected murderers to justice. But at least Michaelsen has some brains and self control. Richetti is a fool.But here's the crux of it.If you're touchy about abusive situations involving children or violent rape or coercive acts involving feces (I'm sorry, there's just no oblique way to say it), you should really consider giving this book a wide berth. At the part about forced coprophagia about two-thirds of the way in -- hey, you're going to have to look it up, I'm not defining it -- I almost put the book down in disgust. And at the end, I'm not so sure I shouldn't have stopped there. Your tolerance for this kind of writing may vary, of course.",0
"I am a fan of H. Beam Piper. Even though his books are a bit dates, they are still fun to read. I wish he was still around to write books after seeing today's technology. It is well worth the $0.99 price tag to get them in Kindle format.",1
THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK..!! it is a classic book that you must have in your collection.  i always enjoyed it since i was a kid,1
It's gay sex written for women who like M/M action. Things happen immediately - no one has any control or finesse. If you like that sort of Insta-Luv drivel then this might be a story for you.,0

"The plot, or what I thought was a plot, was interesting, and it was a good price so I thought I would check this out while waiting for some new books to come out in other various series I am reading.  Anyway, this book is basically all sex, and sex, and more sex.  Not much of a story in between.  I like some erotic scenes, but I am saying this book was just ALL those kind of scenes.  It was just too much sex, and not enough story.  Not at all realistic as far as how things ended up either.  Skip this one!",0
"First this is an excellent kindle edition as it is true to the original and contains no scanning errors also it contains copies of the original artwork which can be zoomed to view in addition there is a glossary which contains words or phrases that may not be familiar and I found myself using the links which were underlined. Also included in the book complete with photographs is a comprehensive biography of L Ron Hubbard.The actual story is typical of the type written at the time when authors had to bash out stories in minimal time to meet editor's time scales and often paid by the word.  I have now read 4 of these books and previously thought that the ""Iron Duke"" was the weakest however I do not think this one is as good. It is a very short story probably best described as fantasy; from the cover picture I thought it was going to be a ""spaceship"" type science fiction. The story centres around a professor who discovers a formula which when allows him to instantly teleport to any destination that he thinks about or is even suggested by someone else but with little control of destination and that is about it  .Worth reading if only to get a flavour of this type of book.",0
"One murder is hardly a killing spree!  Give me a break people!First, let me recommend the book in this fashion:  there are five in the series, all about robots.  This first book you can get as part of the set of 5 for $2.99 (currently) or free by itself.  Get it free and see how you like it.  If you do like it, like me, then buy the series.  You'll still save money buying four more for $3 than each for $1.  I'm just saying.Now, onto the book.What you think is a typical short story about a wallflower computer programmer making a sex robot becomes much more than she bargained for.  Suddenly, after taking her robot for a spin, she's not so shy anymore and an office tryst ends badly in more than one way.  I have to wonder why she didn't turn Frank off before she went to work, that would have solved a lot of problems!I enjoyed it!  Hot.  Weird.  Shocking.  Twisted.  If you want a twisted story about an erotic robot with a screwy sense of monogamy, check this one out.",1
I listened to this book through audible and was just floored.  it is a different story not the same old same old.  I read a lot and this one was totally different --the whole story with the two killers going after the &#34;bad guys&#34; and the two different POVs.  the killers and the FBI agent.  if you read alot and want a story with a different plot and story lineread this !,1

"I have only purchased this book by this author and I'm glad. I coudn't get past the 1st paragraph before I was distacted by grammatical errors. I am not usually so picky, but dang! The tense changed in one sentence! I was disappointed. I may never read this book and it will be a shame. It probably is a good story and I missed it because of bad editing.",0
"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so! It will leave you hungry for more. I have a feeling I'm going to adore book one!",1
"What a bargain for all of Twain's (Clemens) works together, in Kindle form. I'll enjoy this for years, as I re-read my favorites frequently.",1
"SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI actually think that reviewer Lasha described perfectly what I think about this book, but instead of just commenting on her review I decided to make it my own review because this book is a perfect example of why I think GFY trope could be so very offensive in my opinion. I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too, just not in this book in my opinion. I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches. I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff, whatever that meant for them in any given moment. Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual. If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on, just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let's not forget the ""he has gay friends"" thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique, contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on. Yes, sex is hot, no book in my view is still horrible.And those are smart boys, yes? Studying to be pharmacist and another one is supposed to go to prestigious Ivy League business school? One would think their vocabulary would be a little bit more diversed.",0

"**May Contain Spoiler**Where to begin with Only One Love? The premise of the book is good. The idea of lost love that spans literally life times is a great concept. However, this story took a horrible turn into the unbelieveable when it went extreme paranormal and then never really elaborated on it. There was already the special ancient abilities in the Grayhawk family their really didn't need to be more. It didn't add to the story it only took away from it.The hero, Peyton, was totally different than he was in the other books of the series. In the other books he was charming, fun, reliable and in this one he was whiny and selfish. What he does to Cam is really messed up. I could've gotten past it but then he kept whining about it. I wanted to jump into the book and say ""man up!"" And don't get me started on the heroine, Avantae. She was a selfish, spineless, nymphomaniac. All she kept trying to do is get Peyton even though it would ruin his relationship with Cam. Clearly, she learned nothing from her previous lifes mistakes. She pretended to care how Cam felt but she didn't care. Then when she should have put her foot down and stood up for herself she let everyone just lead her around and make decisions for her.All the women of this series are all the same. They don't object to anything, the don't stand up for themselves, they have no self-esteem, they have to be willing to give up everything they are for these men, they have to be willing to come last when it comes to the Grayhawk family and the only thing they can expect to get from their so called ""loves"" is frequent sex, but God forbid they have any desire to be put first at any point. The men sacrifice nothing for these women the women do all the bending, all the waiting, all the being patient, all the understanding and if they ever complain along comes one of the Grayhawk siblings to tell them how beneath their family they are and how lucky they should feel that one of the Grayhawk men even looked their way so they better just accept however they're getting treated or they won't be treated at all. What the women want doesn't matter to the Grayhawk men.And talk about needing their egos stroked. This Grayhawk family need to leave the women of the world alone and just be with each other. All they want is someone to stroke their ego for them. If I had to read about how amazing one of them were again I would have thrown up. It was a little over kill on the Hawk-you're-so-great train. It was so repetitive ""No, you're the best"" ""No, you're the best"" ""No, your better than I am"" ""Oh, no, I'm nothing compared to you, Hawk,"" man, it got bad.The sad thing is I actually like the author. Her book Skin Deep was excellent I loved it, but this series needs emotionally stronger women and a little more give on the male leads part. I'm all for Alpha male but these guys don't care at all for their women. The women add nothing to their lives accept for one more person to toot their horn and are little more than glorified sex toys. All in all I'm giving up on this series but not on the author because she does have the ability to tell a good balanced story, but this series just isn't it.",0
"This was a free download from Kindle, but it did NOT state that it was only a teaser for a forthcoming book.  Why do this when we can download a sample of any book and get almost as much content?  I thought that this was really deceptive, and consequently will not buy the next book.  If you have to read it to be happy,  ***SPOILER***Kaylee is a banshee!  Now you don't have to read the next book to find out.  It isn't worth it.",0
I enjoyed the story about forgiveness and love. The only down side is there a few graphical errors but it did not deter me from finishing the story. Just get a new editor that's all I ask.,1
"I would rate this 0 starts if possible.I had such high hopes for this book! i was excited to read it...The first chapter was good, it pulled you in immediately, but It was boring by the second chapter. I kept  hoping for it to pick up, provide some kind of information, get thick into the plot, or even let you get to know a character. half way through the book there was STILL  NOTHING. A Half of a book of bantering with the ex-wife and psycho brother in law. The son is supposed to be a suspect but yet he wasn't an active character. He said only a handful of things.  The actions of these characters  were far fetched, unrealistic, and ridiculous. Nothing was revealed, there were no suspects to get to know in order to play the ""who dunnit"" guessing game. The characters were unlikable, what you knew of them anyway, and scarce. I almost put the book down, but I decided to plug along since I had wanted to read it so badly when I bought it. At 51% was when I finally learned the first relevant piece of info. At 55% was finally a description of what Raine looked like. Out of 43 chapters, only 5 of them would have been sufficient to tell the same story.",0
"This book has a very high ICK factor.  I liked the idea of being snowbound, especially with a hero like this one.  HOWEVER, how she winds up in his bed and attracted to him is another story.  SHE BELIEVES HE IS HER BROTHER.  He has no idea but every time she is around him, attracted to him, blah, blah, blah, she BELIEVES HIM TO BE HER BROTHER.  Hiagh ick FACTOR FOR ME.  Of course, I figured that in the end he would wind up having a different father because his mother messed around but every time there is a scene of attraction everything in me is screaming HE IS YOUR BROTHER.  Now, if this doesn't bother you, you will probably like the book. But the ick factor was just too high for me to continue.  I think she could have told him, they could have figured it all out and then enjoyed the 3 days snowed in but that is just me.  Ick Ick ICK",0

"As umimpressesed as I was with the first book I thought in all fairness I would give the second book a chance. (It was a cheap download) Total and complete mistake!  This book has no substance. The storyline is boring, the fight scene is laughable, and it didnt start off where the first book ended.  It took all of my will just to finish the book, I kept hoping that something would enlighten me, that something never occured. Im pretty sure I could figure out the plot of the next book and how things will end without actually reading it.

I absolutely love this book! I am so glad I found it and wonder why I never heard of it before. It was just as exciting as my discovery of the Anne of Green Gables series and had a similar feel to it.  The English Orphans was written around 1855 and is a classic rags to riches story. I was glued to my Kindle for two solid days and enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. I experienced both tears and laughter.  Highly recommended!,1
"From the cover I thought I would really like this book. The only thing I liked about it was the cover. There is no mystery or suspense in the book at all. It is very predictable. You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward. All of the characters need more development and are poorly written. I'm not sure what all the 5 star reviews were for. I'm glad I got this as a free download I would not have been pleased if I had paid for this.I normally try to find something I like in a book, but in this one I can't say there is anything.",0

"This bundle brings all the brothers together in this sexy as hell box set. The Buckhorn men as so damn sexy, sweet (yes even Morgan) you'll fall for them in a minute.As always Lori Foster has a great series, read this one a few times. Sawyer my favorite ( sexy as hell doctor) but Morgan although tough as nails ( or thinks he is) is lovable too. Love the closeness of family with all brothers and of course Sawyers son Casey! Who wouldn't love a house full of men (haha). Both Sawyer and Morgan love being single but know with their hometown reputations their not aloud to cut loose but when Honey breaks down Sawyers fence and Sawyers defenses he can't help but fall for this beautiful strong women. Then in comes Misty Honey's sister and when she comes to visit Morgan can't help but strong arm her into loving him. Sawyer is sweet, sexy as hell and romantic and smitten, Morgan is so hot for Misty, he can't get enough, I loved the part where Morgans Naked in the kitchen and Honey makes him dress...too funny.For both Honey  and Misty the men break down their defenses and builds them back up, even though all claim to love being bachelors they get a case of the love bug. Another great series to follow. Can't wait for Casey's storyGabe/Jordan although liked Sawyer and Morgan in buckhorn beginnings more, this sequel is good. Very sexy men, courageous women. Fun and loving family. Great read but wasn't as good as the first book. Even though Jordan and Gabe sexy as all their brothers it wasn't as sexy a story, they both felt almost pushed through to get their happily ever after. Gabe and Jordan are both well sought out bachelors but once they catch their  ideal women their as lost as their brothers. It just felt too quick and rushed I pared to Sawyer (my fav) and Morgan (so sexy)",1
"I saw a really enthusiastic review (5 stars) from a respected reviewer, so got this book.After reading it, I find I'm not nearly as enthusiastic as the others have been; I'll give high marks for the formatting. After having just finished a book that was full of typos & misused words, this one was a pleasure to at least not have that to contend with.I found the story to be just so-so; I really wasn't on the edge of my seat ever, and found myself wishing it would just be over. In fact, it was actually a bit hard to try to follow. When the end finally came it was just a relief. I hate to write a review that's negative, but sorry, that's the way it struck me.I just couldn't give it an honest recommendation.",0

"Pride and Prejudicemash-ups, retellings, sequels, and spin-offs are big business.  This is a retelling of the classic set in a world where there are all sorts of were-creatures.  Although multiple scenes from the original are incorporated into the text, you can really see where the seams are.  One example would be grafting a ""Three Company's""-worthy subplot to keep Elizabeth and Darcy apart.  Instead of the wit, wordplay, and charm of the original, we've got Elizabeth turning down Darcy's proposal because she thinks he's gay.  It isn't homophobic -- just witless.The plot, such as it is, is heavily reliant on action.  I found myself missing the acidic and pragmatic Elizabeth and Darcy more with every page.  Instead we've got these second-rate copies mooning over each other.  I know that instant true love at first eyelock is the current paranormal trend . . . but there is something so amazing about how Elizabeth and Darcy come, in the original, to slowly realize their feelings for each other.  There is a reason some books are classics and others are quickly forgotten.",0

I absolutely loved the lush descriptives that Bri Clark uses in this novella. I could completely picture the woods and the characters that make up this short tale. I loved the aspects of earth magic and healing that made up Aisleen's person but unfortunately the plot and the character development fell short for me. The romance seemed too similar to insta-love and the conclusion felt a bit too abrupt and it left too many questions for my taste.  All in all: Beautifully descriptive but lacking in substance.NOTE: I received a copy of this from the author in exchange for an honest review,0
"I stumbled across `Seducing a Stranger' while looking for another book with a similar title,Strangers Just This Night: Sweet Erotic Romanceby Sandra Ross.  It looked like a good book, so I downloaded it and gave it a quick read, and am very glad I did!`Seducing a Stranger' is a historical erotic story that really puts you in the world inhabited by the characters.  Victoria Paget is a widow seeking proof that her husband, a Captain, was murdered.  She resorts to going to a bawdy house to seduce the Lieutenant that she suspects is responsible for her dear husband's death.  She feels that she has to do this so she won't let him down in death the way she feels she did during his life.  She is a strong, vivid character that is easy to relate to and impossible not to like.Tom Godfrey is the sexy young Lieutenant that is believed by Victoria to be behind her husband's death.  He turns out to be gentlemanly and is extremely surprised to find the widow of his previous Captain in the bawdy house, and he falls instantly in love with her.  Of course, this being an erotic story, I should probably say he fell in lust with her, lol!  The two quickly become involved in a hot, steamy relationship that is put to the test when Victoria finally discloses her beliefs about Tom.I liked the historical aspect of the story, and the author did a good job keeping the language and description appropriate for a historical story.  Although it is hard to develop characters that are believable and likeable in a short story, the author did a commendable job.  I especially like Victoria and the fact that she was willing to go to such extreme measures to get her dead husband the respect she felt he deserved.  I am not sure I could put myself in such a dire situation as selling my body just for answers, and the time period in which the story takes place would have made that an extremely risky endeavor for a widow to undertake.Tom was also a great character; although a true gentleman wouldn't be in a bawdy house in the first place, so that put me off him a little bit.  However, the sexy bits were sizzling and fit the story perfectly.  The descriptions used were exciting and appropriate, and they made the story really stand out.  I would say that if I found other works by this author I would probably read them since I enjoyed this one so much.  I would definitely recommend this book to others, and even though it was not the book I was looking for, it was just right for the mood I was in!",1
Ok I loved this book until about 40 percent then I was just angry and then I loved it again.---spoilers---Ok so I was hooked from the beginning and thought these 2 were so awesome together. Then a part I don't like is it skips to 10 years later.  Ok for one I don't like that it skipped that much time and second how can you feel so strongly for someone but never in 10 years speak of those feelings?? Ok so on to my biggest problem with the book.  The king is pretty much tricked into marrying someone else and yet will continue to sleep with Lassen too.  I see this as a huge betrayal and I don't like cheating in books and that is how I see it.  I know this is apparently common in this timeframe however I still don't agree with this.  For one thing the king explains that he knew they were soul mates before they met and if he knew how much he meant to him how could he sleep with someone else?  Let alone marry someone else?  This just doesn't make sense to me and it cheapens the deep relationship between them.  Also I think Lassen should have been more upset about it and not fallen right into his arms the very next day after the king 's marriage and consummation.  I tried to get over my personal problem with this part and once I did got lost in the story again and I did enjoy it a lot from when Lassen conceives until the end.  All in all this was a great book.  Well written and keeps your attention until the end and the sex is absolutely awesome!!!!,1
"I really liked the start  to this series. The romance is sweet. Smexy Times hot yet tasteful. The action plentiful and butt kicking by both the H and h. They complimented each other well, perfect bond mates both alpha, no submissive for this couple. Eager to see how the next coupe match up.",1

"I love the city of N'awlins & am immediately drawn to any story which draws on the city for inspiration.  When I started reading this book, the 10-year old voodoo-relate CRIME of a child killing her mother drew me in, & I looked forward to reading what I thought would be a story in which the practice of voodoo would play a predominant role.  That , unfortunately, was not the case at all.  Having now read the whole book, I have to say that I am really not sure what the book was about - just a lot of senseless killings that had some tenuous link, at best, to the original 10-yr old murder that actually had nothing to do with voodoo.  Additionally, except for Val, the characters were not at all relatable. And, as noted by other reviewers, sloppy grammar/punctuation permeated the book.",0

"Julia is a writer who's switching to erotic writing.  Ross, her editor, suggests she go up to his cabin so she can have some time alone to start on her novel.  A big snowstorm hits and Ross decides he better go up to keep Julia company and help her with her researching her new novel.  Ross isn't aware that Julia, who is also one of his best friends has always had feeling for him so when he basically offers her sex, it's hard for her to turn him down.  Julia is a little nave when it comes to sex and Ross is more than happy to show her what she's been missing.The book was good.  At times I got tired of how unaware Julia was about sexual things and annoyed with her that even after Ross basically told her how he felt she didn't believe him.  Yes, Ross was made out to be a big player so Julia could be cautious, but when everything happened I was a little surprised she wasn't taking him seriously.  It was still a good read.",1

"First, let me say that I enjoyed this book and the angle that the author took. However, due to the way that it is written, I did not develop any kind of attachment to any of the main characters. This book is basically written as a narrative of events that happened, reminding me of a fictional history book. The book also gets very technical about its development of the space drive and weapons.  Liked it, didn't love it. Will buy the next one to see what happens.",1
"This book is BORING. I downloaded it because the premise is interesting and it had good reviews. Wrong. Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room. The title should be ""Miranda Eats a Meat Pie for Dinner"" because that's all she really accomplishes (Seriously, someone should count up all the time they mention meat pies because it's a lot. I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic. I am mostly annoyed that the author took the time to create this whole interesting, complex universe and then didn't do anything with it. The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too. The point, this book is boring and you should not read it. Now I'm going to eat, for some reason I am craving a meat pie...",0
"I enjoyed this book about a kids going it (almost) alone in the wake of a mysterious catastrophe.  I am a sucker for this genre and I do like the Swiss Family Robinson feel of these kids building a life for themselves in the Mountains.  The idea of the Chief, ruling through the concensus of the group rather than brute force or cunning, was a refreshing departure in such tales.  This is not a Mad Max, Lord of the Flies type of story so if that is your cup of tea, you may want to look elsewhere.  The book does not lack for action but there are long stretches where the folks are just busy trying to stay alive and build their community, so be prepared for this.  I for one would love to read a sequel to find out about Mike as a grownup.",1

To spite his parents he chooses the worst-sounding camp possible, but will his rash action come back to bite him?""Night Camp"" is a book probably aimed towards 9 - 12 year olds and would make a good reader for boys in particular. Shane and his cousin Brad end up in a camp where all the activities are at night and the campers sleep during the day. The tabloid-wielding Brad becomes convinced that camp leaders, Colin and Trevor are actually vampires and in convincing Shane, commences an investigation to find proof and a way out of what has now become a very dangerous camp experience.This story was a lot of fun and written well for the target age group. The simplicity in style didn't blunt the intrigue at all and I found myself eagerly anticipating how the author was going to resolve the mystery. Additionally, you did get some insight into Shane as a main character: his reactions to feelings of abandonment, his discomfort around girls and his growing unease about the decisions he was making.Young children do like to get a bit of a scare and I think this book delivers without becoming too sinister or alternatively, too watered down. I think the younger set will get a kick out of it. There may even be a lesson or two in there, but I didn't feel like I was being bludgeoned to death with them which is always appreciated.Is it for adults? It clearly isn't the target audience, but I certainly didn't resent the experience, so I think adults could enjoy it. There are many moments of embarrassment felt by the characters which might seem a little silly to an adult, but I think the author has done a good job writing from a child's point of view. If the reader can appreciate the story from that same point of view I believe it loses that silliness.I don't read children's fiction often, but this was a fun visit. I hope this story can make its way into the hands of children so that they can experience the anticipation, creepiness and overall enjoyment of reading ""Night Camp"".",1
I don't know why I finished it.  It was beyond weird and stupid.  I don't know how many more words to use than that.,0
"This is a good thriller.  I was reminded of The Day of the Jackal.  Someone is on his way to explode a nuclear weapon in the US and the question is whether he will succeed.  The book is well plotted.  Sadly it is spoiled by some of the worst proof reading I have ever seen.This book contains a language error in virtually every sentence.  The errors are so consistent that someone must have tried to conform to some odd grammar.1.  Plurals.  Most plurals are formed by adding apostrophe s to a noun.  E.g. ""There were three car's in the driveway.""2.  Possessives.  Most possessives were formed by adding s to a noun.  E.g.  ""He opened the Fords passenger door.""3.  Past Participles.  The past tense was consistently used as the past participle.  E.g. ""have went,""have chose,""""have broke,"" etc.""4.  Double negatives.  Some of the best double negatives I have ever encountered are found here.  ""They denied they neither built nor flew the weapon.""Maybe it is just me, but I found it distracting to read a book that had so many errors in language.",0

"Kindle can lose one's place in a book, making it necessary to page through perhaps many hundreds of pages to get back to that point. Perhaps this was an exceptional once only event.  Normally it will automatically go back to the point where one was last reading.  It is also not possible (or at best extremely difficult) to work from different points in a book in random order.  This book is one which is likely to require that facility.  This makes the Kindle unfit for certain purposes.",0

"I know that the cliche plucky heroine can be so annoying, but I'd rather read about that than a gal who is a squishy doormat so besotted with the hero, she takes whatever belittling abuse the hero gives out. I get uncomfortable and have to slog through to the end. So, this was slow, painful going for me.Won't give any revelations away -- and those may make it okay or even uplifting/romantic for angst-loving readers who embrace a self-effacing female lead who 'understands,' 'forgives' and keeps on giving head with an open heart -- but I just cannot get into it, given how much and how relentless he was in his anger at her up front and how limp she was generally. Trick (hero) dug himself into a pretty deep hole from my point of view and she made me want to scream &#34;Wimp.&#34;",0
"A fun, light read with an interesting sci-fi spin. Your mileage will vary with this book depending on how much you like these points:Yaoi and yaoi tropes: One Shot is very reminiscent of reading a lighter, comedic Japanese yaoi manga in print, with its big strong Seme and smaller Uke characters, the ridiculous situations that can stem with sudden growth spurts, and when the Uke is protesting during the beginning of the sexy times but is won over by the overpowering will of the Seme as well as the Uke's own lust for the big strong man. (This was treated as more funny/sexy than dub-con. Nick pushes away at Riley, but Riley's big muscles only revel at the (small) force of Nick's push, and seem to grow bigger. Nick finds it strange and then...fascinating. Do not take this book seriously.)I actually thought it was funny because the book basically yaoi-fies its characters as it progresses. Like, it's starts as a contemporary light romance set in a business setting between boss Nick and younger subordinate Riley. Nick's smart, very hard-working, and endearing with how much he doesn't realize his own appeal. He's also taller than Riley. Then the sci-fi element comes in with the universal flu shot where half of its recipients will also grow taller, a few even much taller. To Nick's chagrin, a small percentage grow smaller and he falls into that pot, and finds himself suddenly 5'8 in an over six feet world. He not only becomes shorter, but he goes full Uke with becoming more delicate looking and his eyes even appear larger. (Do not take this book seriously.)Size Difference: If you like Big vs. Small, then this should hit all your buttons, because Riley's new height towers over Nick's new smaller stature. This means for some awkward sexy times that they try to work through. What's nice about Riley is that, outside of muscle-growing first sexy time (where he bursts out of his clothes like the Incredible Hulk--do not take this book seriously), he's not there to rule over the now seemingly more-delicate Nick but respects him and sees him as the excellent boss Nick is. That was a nice balance between all the looming and shredded shirts. (Riley is very over-protective though, so if you also dig that, this book will probably work for you.)Not a smut-fest: There are sexy times, but the story is mostly a light romance, and the sexy times don't enter until over 40%, and then there are a few scenes dotted through the rest of the story.Nick is nicely clueless in a non-forced way. He's very focused on his work, loves and is calmed by numbers and getting things to be more efficient and effective. He's very self-conscious about his new height difference and thinks everyone is judging him about it, so it's a nice surprise/theme that his nature and personality win over people without him really knowing or trying. There might be some Gary Stu in there, but if there is, it wasn't annoying.This is a light, fun story, and if you're okay with something more yaoi-fied, size differences, bursting clothes, and a sweet, light comfort-read romance, this might suit you well. It's also a little less than 40,000 words, so a pretty fast read. Could be good if you're looking for something lighter to decompress with.",1

"If you're looking for a good and quick read during your lunch or smoke break at work, you probably want to give this one a pass: I wish I did.  I kept wondering where this story was heading and when the ending came I was fairly disappointed I mentally asked ""this is it?""  I wish I wouldn't have wasted the 5-10 minutes it took to read it.The ironic thing is the story description says ""the girls witness the true meaning of life.""  I might be able to extrapolate (with a stretch) on what life lesson he was trying to impart, but I certainly don't see anything thrown out to you directly.I fortunately got this during a free Kindle promotion and now it is 99 cents in the Kindle store as I type this review - save your money!",0

"JustJan summed my thoughts up in her review.  I haven't read the books this novella goes with. Perhaps more emotion comes across in them.  I did like the potential for world building and the customs and culture the author tried to include.  Unfortunately the story that should have had me in tears and really questioning what I might do in the same situation fell flat, and had me having to force myself to finish it instead of moving on to something with more depth.I do still have to give props for the world created because it was more detailed than many short stories are and even full novels. It was also a good basis and idea for a short story, though parts were rushed especially the ending. While I am giving it two stars because it was a bit of a numb read for me, I feel like it did have such potential that I would encourage others to give it a try since it is free and decide for themselves if the style of writing suits their tastes, for the series itself might just be much more flavorfull.",0

"In this book, Flare splits up his squad and gives two others independent command. And they each proceed down a road of incompetence. They are still angry teenage brats. Though they started with some devious plans, the whole story arc devolves into mediocrity. Rather than a struggle to survive, I feel that the branches wander around aimlessly.I had reviewed the first book and mentioned the fight scenes are terrible. I figured out why: the author writes in details that don't matter, and fails to write details that do matter. Many details relate to things such as bodily functions, or shifting packs from one shoulder to another. However, if you get those details wrong, then you break out of the story immersion. All the melee combat scenes reads like that -- details that don't matter, and ones that are outright wrong.The magic scenes had been good up until towards the end of the book. An elf casts a spell to make his hands glow red, then sets two soldiers on fire. That's basically ripped from the Dungeons & Dragons spell, ""Burning Hands"", one of the most useless combat spells ever devised. (You're not going to throw a mage into melee, and if you are, he is going to sneak up on the enemy).Plot is still interesting: let's see what happens at the end of this trilogy.",0

"I like old-fashioned westerns and I like to read those by Zane Grey. He is a particularly good writer, and many of his rip-roarin' westerns have rightly become classics. But be aware a goodly number of his books are more ""prairie romance"" than action-packed western, and in these there's often more huff and bluff than gunfire. Many of his books were not set in the ""old west"" of the past but in ""modern"" times, meaning contemporary to when he wrote them; these often depicted a rugged male abiding by a highly developed sense of fair-play and moral integrity (in contrast to the sneaky ""villain"" who did not), a chaste female heroine, misunderstanding, romance, and overall wholesomeness leading to a happy ending. Several works in this collection--though they  may be set in the western states--are not what we would normally call ""westerns,"" and others are baseball stories and nonfiction accounts of fishing and camping. Sadly the majority of his greatest westerns are not yet inexpensively or freely available in public domain editions. No matter what he wrote (prairie romance, baseball stories, fishing accounts, or classic westerns), Grey knew how to tell a good story, and his vivid descriptions are second to none.UPDATE 05-08-13: You may wish to compare this set of 26 to another Zane Grey collection recently published by Wildside Press as ""The Zane Grey Megapack."" Attractively formatted and offering 42 novels and stories for only $.99, that now seems like the better deal.",1

"When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer, I discovered Zane Grey western novels. The very first one I read was East of the Pecos, and it thrilled me. It had action and adventure, horses which I loved, and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it. The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved. I can't remember how many I read. Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago, I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks. Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents. I grabbed it, and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me. I'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land. Not at all. The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I'd read the first book in this collection, I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco, Texas. Walking through the museum, I realized how accurate were Grey's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful, and it's worth far more than the modest price. The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long.",1

"Colters' Wife (Colter's Legacy #1.5) by Maya Banks is a sequel to Maya's most popular book, Colters' Woman where three brothers all share the same woman and end up ""marrying"" her. I haven't read Colters' Woman since I'm not a big fan of siblings involved in a polyamorous incestuous relationship regardless if the siblings aren't sexually attracted to one another. In Colters' Wife, each Colter brother has one-on-one time with the pregnant heroine, Holly. There's no threesomes or quartet loving going on here.Colters' Wife goes as follows: Pregnant woman has sex with three brothers at different times, falls down a ditch, gives birth, The End. The sex was hot but there really wasn't much of a plot.When Holly fell down the ditch, I was expecting some Lassie type dog to run and get help. Unfortunately, no lovable dog appeared, and because of this I had to lower the grade because nothing says happily ever after like a woman married to three brothers and a pet dog they can all love and cherish. But then the dog wouldn't be able to sleep in their bed because there's no room with three brawny men and one small woman sleeping together.If you're a fan of Maya's Coulter series, you'll enjoy this short. It's both cheesy and equally disturbing having three brothers sharing one woman. Holly must be exhausted from all the Colter loving she gets. But then again Holly doesn't have any complaints because the triple threat Coulter men are too perfect for words and have all the right moves.Katiebabs",0

"""When people talk about the South being haunted, it's true.  But it's not the places that are haunted, it's the people.  They are trapped by all the stories of the past...""  (Location 89)The narrator of ""This is Not a Love Story"" by Lydia Peelle is a woman whose daughter has gone off to college and she is looking back on her youth because of some old photos that her daughter found while packing.When she was twenty-two, our narrator left Connecticut and went to a small town in Georgia to start what she thought would be a lifelong career as a photographer.  She saw the South as ""raw and dangerous and full of relics of a long-gone era."" (Loc 34) Despite her lack of creativity, what the South offered would more than make up for anything she might lack.  As many often do, she wished later on that she had listened to family's and friend's advice.  Finding Tommy, twice her age, was great fun in the beginning.  Tommy lived on a boat on the lake and didn't work, had parties all the time and drank a lot.  And the nights in Valdosta looking for Tommy in the bars started to get to her.  The title of the story is right.This is a very well-written short story and is the first of this author's writing that I have read.  There is an anthology with more of Peelle's short stories in it which I would like to read.  What happens in the story is believable and realistic and the characters are well-thought out and seem authentic.Highly recommended.",1

However, the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries.

"Holly North has agreed to something completely out of character.  As an accountant she would never strut about looking like an `X-rated Mrs. Claus, but with a little pleading and begging from her friend that's exactly what she's going to do.  Due to the illness that has been sweeping through Sugar Plums, a Christmas-themed strip club, Holly dons the Mistress Christmas getup - adds a velvet mask and struts her stuff for the crowd.Detective Nick West is on a mission.  Granted it's entirely off the clock since his friend didn't want to file a report about the supposed robbery that occurred at Sugar Plums.  He's dead set on taking down the thieving Mistress Christmas - until he gets a good look at her.  Now he's far more interested in uncovering all her secrets on a personal level than pursuing her in any legal manner.For Holly the freedom allotted along with anonymity is a real eye opener.  Especially once she meets Nick who promises that he's definitely more sinner than saint.  He's the epitome of all her sexual fantasies rolled into one tight, hot package that she would love to find under her Christmas tree tied neatly with a bow.  Reality is that as an accountant he would probably never give her a second look but she's incognito and as Mistress Christmas she's allowed to be more bold and daring than she'd normally dare.  Their first meeting is full of sexual innuendoes and Christmassy humor but it's the lap dance he insists on that really turns up the heat.  Nick is a little confused since as a seasoned stripper Holly should know the rules about touching or kissing during the session.  Instinctively he knows that Holly is innocent of wrongdoing but as a seasoned detective it's hard to let go of his concerns.When Holly confides her naughty Christmas wish well, Nick's certainly not going to disappoint her - especially when her wish is one night of sexual decadence ... with him!  Neither of them knows the truth about the other.  He believes her to be a stripper who may or may not be robbing the men she dances for and all she knows about him is he's a Wyoming cowboy who does lots and lots of paperwork in his current occupation.  Their deceptions may prove to be problematic in the future but for this one night, they're going to do far more than get tangled up in the tinsel.Lorelei James is certain to bring a smile to your face with this holiday inspired tale.  MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is full of smart and sassy characters, sexually charged situations, a little suspense, and plenty of chuckles.  Holly and Nick complement each other beautifully and I got a huge kick out of being privy to their relationship as it developed.  The whole time I was reading I wondered how Nick's `investigation' would turn out and I have to tell you it was nothing like I expected.  Ms. James certainly throws readers a curveball on that one.  This is a wonderful story and well worth adding to your keeper shelves.MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is the first story in a brand new series entitled the WILD WEST BOYS.  While I can't find anything about future releases in this series I'll definitely be on the lookout for them.  Will also be going back and reading the ROUGH RIDERS books since I discovered this series is loosely connected to them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"Well written? To describe this book as that is a stretch. However, I did find myself highliting sone parts, especially toward the end. It's a medium read. The beginning was bad. The author doesn't develop her ideas well, and randomly starts using French. The middle made me like the main characters, and the ending was abrupt! She so couldve developed that better. It's also hard to believe the relationship between Viva and Joel. Still, an overall pleasant story. 2.5 stars overall, and I like a good chick lit read.",0

"The story of who murdered liquor store owner, Manny, and now threatens the life of high school teacher, Jessie Jones, could have been an interesting tale in the hands of a capable author.  Unfortunately, what we have here is an inane full length book that should have been a short story at best.  It is 5% story and 95% filler fluff.I keep asking myself WHEN novice story writers will cop to the fact that page after page of painful inner dialogue by the main (or any) character is a sure fire way to make any book a big fat zero.This 'book' is all over the place.  The author would have done well to sit down prior to writing and compose an outline as to what the main theme of the book would be and then FOLLOW that outline.  There is so much ridiculous, extraneous activity going on that it is close to impossible to follow what I took to be the main point of the book: the murder of Manny and the protagonist's unwilling involvement in the crime.In one scene you have some silly mishmash about an upcoming wedding, in several others you have Jessie doing battle with the big 'meanies' in her life...characters, by the way, who are so one dimensional as to be laughable.  In other scenes she is agonizing over a long dead romance (ten years) when her erstwhile lover turns out to be lead investigator on the murder at hand.These characters insult the reader's intelligence mercilessly.  Are we really supposed to believe that Jessie, after narrowly escaping death and then having her house torched, lists wearing a hideous maid of honor dress in her sister's wedding as one of her top three current concerns?  Give me a break.Another idiotic character is that of Jessie's mother.  This is a woman who supposedly made her way through medical school and became a respected surgeon while at the same time raising two children and yet whose main focus is getting her daughters married off.  The mindset just doesn't jibe.I find myself skipping page after page after page of imbecilic tripe just to get to the next coherent passage that might just relate to the mystery at hand.I'm afraid that whomever murdered Manny will have to remain a mystery to me because I've lost all patience with this miserable excuse for a book.",0
"A great collection of short stories ranging from locked-room mysteries to horrors to parody and satyre :) That being my first &#34;meeting&#34; with J. A.

I loved the twists and the humour, although I probably sometimes missed on the cultural/local puns - as I am not a native-speaker of English, which has not in the least taken any joy and fun from the reading:DDefinitely a must for anyone who likes intelligent, somewhat crazy and funny story-telling:D",1
"The story was free and I was so glad.  I gave it 2 stars because it was written well, but really all the book was about was sex.  Well, the story did include the two touring the City.  I didn't feel any chemistry between the two, because their wasn't any.  I started skipping pages whenever sex came up and finally came upon a plot (near the end) where Homeland Security misidentified Rene and deported him.  So now we are no longer in the sex zone, but have moved into the ridiculous zone, with the Secretary of State Heidi Klinton flying to the rescue.",0
"Carpenter did a brilliant job of writing these two individuals into one and other's lives.  They are compatible, they are loving, and both need to deal with skeletons.  In the end, will they make work?  You just have to read to know.",1
"An awful, rushed, careless cowboy imitation of The Clans of Kalquor, a much better series.*SPOILERS*The brothers practically jumped on her at first sight, groping and dominating her within hours without any consideration to her feelings at all. They take her virginity without even slowing down or preparing her, *all* of her virginity. They find out how old she was, almost a hundred years ago, and *gasp* she's suddenly jailbait. ""Oh ick, we don't want you any more, and we don't care about your safety either""There was nothing redeemable about this book at all. I read almost everything else by this author and loved it all. That makes this one just that much more a slap in the face.",0
First time reading a book about a person who can shift into more than one animal.  A good read not the best but it kept my interest the whole time,1
This was a good mix of historical fact and fantasy. Might be read for older children with a caution that there is some violence involved.,1
This was fine. I. Thought it could be better but I have read a lot of many books that much much better.,0
Gratuitous violence. Not much imagination. Fortunately a quick read or I wouldn't have had the patience to finish the book.,0
what is with the big star ratings? the characters behavior was so unrealistic i couldn't go on. it was ridiculous.,0
And good tittle but not much else here. I bought more but got only a good title. No thanks for that.,0
Henry unravels a real who-done-it and how the heck did they do it mystery. Plot is a surprising mix of murder and a little romance for Henry.,1
"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason, he thought, but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read.",1
"Good story, good characters, great setting. I'm very tempted to look up further books in this series, because I love stories about rebuilding society after an apocalypse. This was a nice little novella, perfect length for a quick read.",1
"I give this story four stars for the story--the story was different and good.Unfortunately, the mechanics were really, really, really bad--two stars for grammar/punctuation/word usage or lack thereof!  new/knew; preachers/preacher's; asses (n) (wild donkeys) instead of assess (v); in case is two words; forefront and forerunner are one word; Bible is capitalized; no sense of how and when to use commas, periods, and apostrophes.Ms. Pray, please go to any high school and talk to the English teacher; he/she may be glad to proof your manuscripts for an inexpensive price, if not free.You should be able to write your language as well as you speak it!!  These mistakes are high school level and it's the main reason why so many e-books are so bad!!  Not for the story itself, but for the mechanics of writing!",0
"Enjoyed reading this one... moves along well, plot welldeveloped, interesting and entertaining.  I will buy and read his books in the  future.",1
"Mark Twain is one of my favorite authors and as his other works put a smile on my face so did this one.  This tale gives us food for thought.  As always, a great classic!",1
Cute yet exciting.Would of liked moreVicki took no time to seduce her new tenantI loved it totally.,1
Written in a different era it still enthralls. I read Bulldog Drummond as a kid and it seemed wonderful then. It is still good now but the writing is dated and some expressions and points of view are clearly politically incorrect. Steer past that and the stories are fun to read and like James Bond for the early 20th Century. The writing reminds me of the Biggles books.,1
"I read about 60% of the  book and couldn't take it anymore. I really liked the story line and the idea for this book, but the writing was so annoying; too much description and too contrived for me. The ""heroes"" were over the top in abilities and preparation and knowledge. This is one book that I am glad didn't cost more than $1.",0
Loved the story can't wait for the book in this serious. I  normally don't say much about the grammar or sentence structure or pay .such attention when I read what others say about it but this time they were so on the money the spelling  grammar and sentence structure was awful. Will I read more  by her? Yes,0
"I love old westerns, and I'm not too critical of them so long as they are well-written. Max Brand can write well, but there is a sameness to his word products. His heroes often tend to be introspective loners on the lam, and thus we get a strong psychological component. But, since Brand was paid by the word, there is also a tendancy toward wordiness; this, when combined with the aforementioned introspection, seems to prolong even the simplest actions.Brand wrote some good books; he was bound to writing so very much and in so many different genres. Indeed, many of his books (such as the Doctor Kildare series) are not westerns. But forced to churn out verbiage in magazine stories and short novels to make a living, too many of his tales seem perfunctory and more than a tad familiar, one to the next. And some plot devices are downright odd. That so many of hs books are as highly regarded as they are is certainly to his credit, but overall there is some hard-to-define quality (angst, perhaps?) about his western stories that doesn't particularly appeal to me; they somehow don't ring true. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy his stories, this set conveniently packages many of Brand's currently available public domain works.UPDATE 04-27-13: Wildside Press has just published a particularly well-formatted, 20-title ""Max Brand Megapack"" for only $.99. You will probably wish to sample both, but THAT is the one I would recommend.",1
"This story has all the elements of a good erotic romance and then some, i.e. humor.  I was delighted and enchanted with this uber sexy spin on a childhood favorite.  Should definitely be read by fans of erotic romance.  The plot is not complex but I was Wooed by it's sensuality.  Well, I'm off to, not see the wizard you silly goose, off to find another book by R.G. Alexander. Enjoy!p.s. On second thought, maybe I'll dash across the rainbow and find my own ""Z"" Yum!",1
Did not cut it. Maybe I don't like the way Mr. Hewson writesNot enough to peak my interest. Sorry.,0
"I could have given this five stars but in the end decided on four. It is an excellent book but it is not for everyone. Realistic, perhaps too much so. Painful, definitely but well worth the read.",1
This book makes so much sense and it's practices are easy to follow I've read many books on this subject and this by far is the easiest to apply thank you for the helpful strategies.,1
"~* 1.5 Stars *~Yoga instructor and business owner Kerri Harris and divorce attorney Mitch MacAuley have been best friends for years. Only friends. But when Kerri and Mitch are out one night sharing a friendly drink, she tells him she wants to marry and asks Mitch to introduce her to some single, eligible men. There's nothing Mitch wouldn't do for Kerri, but her request bothers him. A lot.As she starts to date the guys he reluctantly introduces her to, he gets more and more uncomfortable and tension rises in their friendship. Soon the friendly quips between them that used to be teasing fun take on more bite and a decade long friendship goes from smooth to rocky. Tensions and tempers rise between them. Pushed to the brink, a fight between them ends in a kiss - a wild, tempestuous kiss that changes everything...but solves nothing. Can two friends accept the fact that they're made for each other or will the differences between them kill their friendship and destroy the chance for love?Despite the fact that the friends-turned-lovers theme is one of my favorites in contemporary romance, I had way too many problems with this book to be charmed. The plot was two dimensional and predictable, the narrative lacked sophistication, the dialogue lacked conversational flow, and the characters lacked charm.The characters were the biggest problem. More specifically, Kerri. Mitch had little to recommend him as a romantic lead, but he wasn't overly objectionable, despite an unhealthy anger management issue or two. Kerri, on the other hand, I found to be utterly contemptible. She blames Mitch for everything that goes wrong in their relationship, takes no responsibility for her own actions or feelings on any matter, flits between wildly contradictory emotions at a blink, is pathologically immature, and is grievously self involved. I may not have warmed up to Mitch, but I actively disliked Kerri.The romance started to improve towards the end, but ended up floundering when the dialogue took a turn for the worse. Two comments in particular stick in my mind, at the turning point for the relationship between Mitch and Kerri, Mitch says the following:""I want to be with you, and most of all, I don't want anyone else to be with you.You think you need a husband? Fine, then - it's going to be me.""You want kids and I want them to be mine. Nobody else's.""Neither one of those comments come anywhere near my idea of romance, nor do they inspire a lot of confidence in the relationship. Mitch comes off seeming less interested in being with Kerri because he loves her and more interested in making sure that she's not with anyone else. Admittedly, these comments are taken out of context, but they provide examples of the problems I had with the dialogue.On the positive side, Jamieson writes very sensual, erotic sex scenes. The naked yoga in particular was a sultry, seductive delight, and as a whole the sex was very well done and provided the best written scenes in the book. The rest, unfortunately, didn't work for me.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",0
"After the death of her husband, Aggie Underhill moves to southern California to be close to her daughter and grandson. But, when dead bodies start appearing in the strangest places, Aggie can't contain her curiosity, and along with her best friend Betty, starts to investigate the murders. A fun, quick and easy read.",1
This was my first audio book that I listened to all the way through. I really liked how the narrator wasn't monotone in her reading. I would have liked to get more on the story of Emma and the school dance and how Kaylee came into this gift. All in all for this book being free I was quite impressed on the over all story. Kaylee and Lydia's bonding was one of my favorite parts as well as Lydia sacrificing herself for Kaylee.,1
"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsThis is the best Markhat ""story"" I have read so far. I put ""story"" in quotes because, although it's that way in the title, this is actually a novel.The plot was original with a gritty, noir setting. The fantasy world of Markhat was enthralling. Mr. Tuttle really knows how to draw the reader into a different world by showing the way things are, instead of just telling about it.The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.Although this book is part of a series featuring the character of Markhat, like the others, it can be read as a stand-alone.Character Development: 5 StarsMarkhat was a wonderfully deep character with an interesting past that was revealed in bits and pieces throughout the story. He was always `in character' with believable motivations.Mama Hog was also present in this installment. I was happy to see her again as she is the perfect companion and mother-figure for Markhat.The new characters introduced in this book were also very well-drawn. Each had their own motives and personalities, making them likable or easy to hate, as needed.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle was in his usual fine form. There was humor interlaced through even the most gruesome portions. The humor was sometimes blatant and, at other times, a bit obscure, but always there if a reader cared to look, and I did.The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was snappy and in good form. Everyone spoke with just the right amount of accent to be believable and have a unique voice. The sentence structure was complex, but flowed easily.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: PG-13 for Blood and Gore, Oblique References to Prostitution, Violence",1
"I like sentences with a subject and a verb--in fact, those are the two essential ingredients for a string of words to be called a sentence.  I don't mind chopped up bits in dialogue, but this book contains too many narrative passages with phrases passing as sentences.  &#34;White chocolate eyes with dark chocolate irises.&#34;  &#34;Set him down and started another.&#34;  &#34;Perfect.&#34;  These are not sentences, and every time I came across one of these it jerked me out of the story and made me wonder what sort of editing the book had received.I found the book's premise implausible as well.  Mysteries create a puzzle that must be solved with the clues that the author hides in the story.  A magic box and special powers belong in fantasy writing, not in a mystery set in modern America, unless you wish to create a magic world existing alongside or within our normal, non-magical one--like the Harry Potter books.  The author gives no rationale for magic of any kind, and it throws off the whole equation--it's a cheap way to cheat.  I didn't finish the book.",0
slow at first but totally suspenseful to the very end. glad I stuck through to find out an ending that you can't possibly have imagined,1

"Cheated.  Didn't know what I was getting.  I didn't know this was part of series and this was middle, or something.  And blah blah reading and reading and reading and waiting for something...all the while, I was in the MIDDLE of something bigger (series).  Would have been NICE TO KNOW.  Not going to hop on series train in near future because of this.",0
"This is the story of Conner and Faelan.  Conner gives his girlfriend of six months a promise ring and Faelan starts itching and her skin turns silvery after she's been wearing it. It also gives her some other feeling of need, which I won't go into in my review.  I won't spoil the whole story by telling any more.This really did read like the opening to what could have been a novel had it been developed a little better.  There is one explicit scene between Conner and Faelan that just seems much too frantic & needy. The story just ends all of a sudden.  I would have given this 2.5 stars because it has a lot of potential.At the time I downloaded this to my kindle it was being offered free in the kindle book store, which in no way affected my review of this short story.",0

If she wants it that is.Can Clarissa take on the role as the ""special"" bride or will she think what Logan and Derek are offering is too scandalous for her?Ms. Saint James puts an interesting twist on a well known plot line, the mail order bride.  I found this twist as well as the interactions with the characters to make for a fun and fast read.  I am interested in seeing where this series heads, and hope to see more of Clarissa and her men in the future.  I enjoyed Mail Order Bride for Two and look forward to more from Ms. Saint James.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"Oh, wow. This is why I got a Kindle, to find fun new authors who write new and original stories. Dead Man's Rain is set in a gritty world where magic happens, but it's not common, where ogres live alongside humans and the occasional elf, where rich vampires hunt the night with the permission of the local authorities, and where finder Markhat has unwanted assistance in getting cases from his neighbor, the card reader Mama Hog. And then you get to the case itself . . . .Along with creating fascinating characters, the author gives a lot of little details that make the story come alive.One note, though: as other reviewers have mentioned, this is a short story/novella and not a novel.Would I reread this book? I already have.Would I spend money on this book? I would, and I did.

But when she is in a club where Taran is conducting an investigation, their lives collide in a big way and Taran has to watch Lark closly in order to save her life.I enjoyed this story but I didn't connect with the characters, I enjoyed the read but the resolution wasn't concise. This is a continuation of the story from Ready to Run but there was little mention of the gang of European shifters who were abducting women.

"This is the most frustrating book I have read in a long time. The blurb sounded great but the moment I started reading I regretted it. I found myself skimming more than reading because the story was too confusing to do anything else. In the story, the heroine, Tammy, use of words/language was jolting throughout the story. She seemed to speak as though she was out of touch with reality, then again, maybe she was. The story timeline is so off that I had a hard time distinguishing how much time had passed. The sex scenes seemed forced and only added in because the author had to make this a romance somehow. It has been a long time since I felt like I have wasted my money on a book and I have to say this was one. I think this author has potential but it definitely wasn't reached here.  I can't recommend this book.",0

The hottest thing about this book (IMO) is the book cover and the second hottest thing about it is the product description.  I am wondering if someone else wrote the description for the author because inside the book the writing isn't very good.  The book definitely needs editing.  It reads like a choppy rough draft because of the numerous grammatical errors.  The book contains Master/slave as well as several f/f scenes.  This book was not what I expected.  I even went back and reread the product description to make sure I was reading the correct book on my kindle.  Save your money!,0
"It doesn't really show what life is like in a Tank.  It shows cheery and gallant young chaps enjoying their leaves, occasionally gallantly charging the German lines.  It does illustrate that the British didn't know what the hell to do with their new tanks.  They're used in twos or threes, to take a trench or two, and then brought back, instead of being used en masse to create a new fortified line.  Almost certainly written with approval of the War Department.",0
"I knew that this was a multiple partner story before I read it.  I picked it up intentionally to see if buying the first book would be worthwhile.  I have decided against it.  There were just too many creep factors for me, personally, to become that involved in the characters or even to find the love scenes all that erotic (in fact, I found them very bland).  The creep factors were:1. The three men are brothers, which I hadn't expected to be that bothered by but once I started reading I didn't find it intriguing at all or believable.2.  The female protagonist systemically ""corners"" each brother and practically begs for sex from each man in turn.  Just not sexy or romantic.3.  She's 8 months pregnant at the time.4.  They all call the child ""theirs""...he is ""their son""...as in they do not know who fathered the baby and so all claim him. Something about this went against my own peace of mind.  Maybe too...cult-like?  Takes me to number 5...5.  The entire scenario is so unrealistic that even for a book I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  The author writes the 4-way relationship as a pleasant, laid back one, with no jealousy issues or the woman just throwing her hands up and saying ""I need space, quit touching me for one freaking minute"".  All is perfect in their world, nobody minds sharing and they all know each other's business.  And sure, the heroine is well cared and the men genuinely love her, but at the same time she is overly cossetted.  It left me feeling like she had no real freedom, always surrounded by men hovering over her.  She didn't have enough of an independent spirit for the heroines I usually like reading about.  Oh, and the birth scene was poorly written and also not realistic at all.Some people will like and have liked this story just fine and are not bothered by any of the things that bothered me.  I tried it and I just didn't like it.",0
"I had great hopes for this book. The premise was different and interesting...a combination that usually spells winner. Unfortunately, not in this case. The pacing drags, there are inconsistent character issues with Brian, (he's known he's different his whole life but describes things and acts in ways that point toward the opposite fact), and then there are the editing issues. Every book has them, so I try to overlook small errors. Sometimes though, there are just too many. Others may enjoy the unique premise and action without being distracted by the things that bothered me.",0
"This story serves as a vehicle for the author's message and, as vehicles go, it's the equivalent of a base model -- there's a story, but it isn't original or interesting.Abby is a scientist and, since she's in a Christian story, she's on a collision path with events destined to show her that science can't explain everything, blah blah blah blah.  Of course, her closed-minded peers can't handle this, so she is ridiculed by everyone except for her kindly professor.  Eventually she has a chance to be a true hero of faith and so on.  It's the plot of a thousand different Christian stories.  This one has some mild frights and gore with demon possession, but even those elements felt warmed over.Even if you're seeking reading material to validate your Christian worldview, there are better stories out there.",0

"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan, there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that, her best writing, in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total, the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series, you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!",1

No one expects a little red head girl to be one of their best allies inside, a little girl whose mother is just as passionate as her daughter, and one with too many secrets. A chance to get to know the cute little pair is something Boomer can't let go even if the hospitality comes with a hidden agenda. An agenda that puts him, his little savior and the mother he wants in deadly harm.I will admit right off the top I'm a huge fan of this author's work. Boomer's Fall was a highly anticipated story I've been waiting on since reading the sequel Black Smoke. A book I have to say was Top Choice. I wasn't sure what to expect from Boomer's Fall, because as a whole I fell in love with Boomer and the entire team but especially ""Black Smoke"". She's the glue that holds the entire team together and in this story she's the reason, along with the full inclusion of the rest of the team, I was able to enjoy it. I love Boomer! He's an appealing male hero, and the little girl Raya was a pure doll. I just couldn't connect with Hannah, Boomer's love interest. From first glance she was more of residual figure for me than a really appealing heroine. I found myself falling in love with the surrounding plot and action more than the connection between the main couple. I was concerned as I sat down to write this review because I am such a huge fan of this series. Robin Leigh Miller really created another fascinating plot and as always there were tons of tension laced moments and action that leaves you sweating. My final thoughts are this is a kick butt story, great plot, tons of excitement and the paranormal twists aren't too over the top but if you're looking for a great romance this might not be it.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"After readingAn Unwanted Hunger (V'Kar)andAll in Time, I swore to myself that I would avoid Ciana Stone's books.  For some reason, I thought the name of this book's author was ""Chula Stone"" (that is even how it appears on my Kindle).  While this is very different in tone that the previous two books I've read by the author, I wouldn't say it is better.  In fact, in very significant ways, it is much, much worse.Lyra Seville is a young woman who just got her Master's Degree in Parapsychology (from Duke University, and I'm sure they'd be thrilled to know they were dragged into this whole mess).  Lyra is an adult and she is supposed to be of reasonable intelligence, but she still can't figure out how to get the money left to her by her parents from her aunt/adoptive mother (her aunt adopted her after her parents died).  Despite the fact that their relationship is clearly explained at the beginning of the book, Lexi will be referred to as Lyra's ""stepmother"" for most of her subsequent appearences.Lyra is a beautiful dark-haired/blonde woman (Stone can't make up her mind) who has just never found love.  Somehow she got all the way through high school, college, and graduate school without ever feeling the urge, so she's a virgin.  Her friend encourages her to go out and see a handsome magician at a local nightspot and BAM -- she falls in instant lust.Meanwhile, there is a crazy kill-rape cult kidnapping women and killing them.  Pages and pages and pages pass and it becomes clear that Nick, her handsome magician beau, may not be what he seems and Lyra is the target of the kill-rape cult.  Her virginity is of prime importance to them, leading to a bizarre scene where she is finger-violated in the woods and the doctor checking her out helpfully lets us know that she is still intact.  Plus, he adds, ""I'd bet my stethoscope"" that the kind of lube used on the assailant's glove was the same used at the hospital . . . based on the SMELL.  How exactly did that examination go again?  And why is that even an important detail (trust me, the case isn't cracked based on lube brand).Nick's old friend Detective Michael Santera gets involved and suddenly our virginal heroine has another love interest.  Also, Lyra inherits a house from a dead magician, so they move into that to hide from the bad guys.  The story goes on and on and on and on.  Lots of women get raped and killed, Lyra visits a farm, an old diary provides classically clunky exposition, there is a flashback to a murder onboard a ship that doesn't really fit at all, an evil count shows up, and Lyra has to use every brain cell in her brunette/blonde head to survive.The book is easily 100-200 pages too long for the weight of the story that it has to tell.  Lyra and her friend spent a couple of weeks hiding and the story just drags.  The story is driven by the discovery of the diary and spirit guides, truly lazy storytelling.  The main bad guy, ""the Adversary,"" is given an entire clunky backstory that barely stands up.  Once you finish the book and realize who is actually good and who is actually evil, virtually every character has done things that make zero sense.  The characters act as if their presumed motivation is their real one, but once their real allegances are known, so much of what they have done no longer makes sense.  There is an overreliance on viceral responses to provoke engagement from the reader, but there are only so many times you can read about a dead woman, never in the story, being found with stuff cut off of her, before you don't care at all.To top it all off, the editing is w-r-e-t-c-h-e-d.  The books I have previously read by Stone didn't have this issue.  It seems as if it wasn't proofed at all and there are multiple places with some sort of formatting issue that causes a single name to be repeated for a line or more.Bottom line:  this book is too long, the plot is terrible, and there is no attention to detail.  Even if you get it for free, your time is worth something, right?",0
Not t all ha I expected. Stopped reading it because I didn't like the flow or where it was going.,0
"This was a very emotional, and touching story. Lilly in her first marriage, had a miscarriage, a stillborn. Her last pregnancy she had her son, which was born with birth defects. He didn't live long. Her husband couldn't stand to look or hold his own son. It tore Lilly's heart apart. She loved her son with her heart and soul. After the funeral, she received divorce papers. She now works for an adult daycare.  She loves her job, and knows she is helping other families. Lilly and jack were dating, but Jack broke it off. The two still cared for each other. When they found out Lilly was pregnant, Jack stepped up to the plate. Lilly was scared, and Jack gave her his strength, and comfort. This is a book I think all should read. It was really moving.Sample from chapter 7 - His goal was to take the necessary steps to help his daughters adjust to a blended family and to make sure Lilly's decision to marry him was well thought out and deliberate. That it was a decision she'd never regret. And if he had to woo her one dinner date, one yoga class, one shopping spree at a time, he'd do it gladly.Sample from chapter 8 - ""The baby could have so many things wrong, it would never be able to leave home and might need machines to stay alive."" ""That sucks."" Yes, it did. ""I have to go, sweetie."" Lilly patted Miranda's shoulder. ""Please don't tell anyone about the baby until I say you can. Okay?"" ""My mother doesn't tell people about me, either."" ""I can't believe that,"" Lilly said vehemently, although admittedly, she didn't know Miranda's mother. Her sister always brought her to the center. ""Sometimes, when she thinks I'm not around, she says she only has one daughter."" ""Oh, Miranda."" Lilly could have cried. The young woman crewed up her face into an angry scowl. ""I bet if you had a kid like me, you'd be the same way."" Lilly pulled Miranda into a fierce hug. ""If I had a daughter like you, I'd be so happy and s proud, I'd tell everybody I met about my beautiful girl, and how much I loved her.""",1
"First, this is the type of science fiction that I term bubble gum. It is light on content but satisfying as a quick entertaining read. The characters are largely superficial as are their interactions, the technology is easily acquired and quickly put into action. It contains the almost cliche single inventor who single-handedly launches mankind into the stars. It is still entertaining as a quick light read not to be taken too seriously. I have read all three in the series and the observations are similar.",1
"""You are going to stripe naked one way or the other, and if I'm insane, you've damn well made me that way. Now, are you going to do it yourself, or shall I help?""Parker can kidnap me any day he wants. Now while his tacit might seem a little brute I promise it's not like that at all. Parker has just come to the end of his rope and is just grabbing the bull by the horns.  Lucky for him it was the perfect plan. The book jumps out the gate with steamy sex that left me more than satisfied.At times it seemed like Celia was running the sex show which was funny being as she was the kidnapped but once you get into the book you realize that fits her personality to a T. Celia is feisty, audacious, and brings all the humor to the novel. She's even cocky but not in an annoying way but a humorous one, even more so for the times.  I can see why Parker chased after her for years because she was worth the chase in my option.I find it hard to find good historical western erotica's for some reason and this one was perfect to me. Even with it being a novella we still got to see the chemistry of the two characters and why they fit so well together. There is even a side story that got my attention.Mistress M[...]",1
I loved the book it's like I was back visiting the westmoreland family again to see what they were doing.,1
Well written and unusual romance. 4 1/2 stars really. Would have rated it higher but some of the interactions between hero and heroine would never have been sanctioned by the mores of the time period.,1
"There was an interesting twist on the menage relationship.  Though they were two men that did normally share their women they found that when their feelings were involved it wasn't so easy. I also loved the supporting characters. Especially Jacob. He was an older man, that when he lost the love of his life, decided to devote his life to saving young women who had difficult pasts and needed a bit of help to get their lives back together.  And Derek, his son, had a hard time growing up sharing his father's attention with all the women he saves. Nathan is his best friend, who he shares Beth with, though not so easily at first. And Beth had quite the troubled past with a step-father who abused her and believes she is having a sexual relationship with all three men. So after state cut-backs set him free of prison, he goes after Beth.So lots of love, action and a bit of suspense, that makes for a great story.",1
"Ok!The story was not to my liking. It was a sweet story but it just never drew me in.  It lack substance, that special thing that draws the you in.  Sorry but it lacked something.",0
"This story is very sensuous, there is food, flowers and romantic obsession. She was raised to be his wife. He didn't want her, and as a result all doors closed to her. She chose perhaps the most difficult path out of her predicament, but she is never entirely free of the beginning of her story -- until she finally is forced to face it. Good sci-fi, good writing, loved the ending.",1

"I've read a few other Kelly Jamieson books and this one was the best so far.  I liked both the hero & heroine and was rooting for them all the way.  I thought the relationship seemed believable between Kerri & Mitch and I was glad they didn't just fall into bed right away.  The only relationship that seemed a little rushed was Kerri & her sister Sela.  I thought the resolution between them was too quick & neat.  Overall, this was a good story.",1
"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to ""show"" him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much.",1
"This is one of those times where I wish we could score 1/2 stars, I would give 1 1/2 here.The author really tried, and as someone who has been trying to finish his own murder mystery, I applaud him for his work.However, the writing was so clumsy and awkward.I felt like I was reading a letter (and a poorly written one at that).  ""He said....and then she said....and I told them.""Show, don't tell - the primary rule of fiction writing - is what's missing here.  I feel like I was told a story and not shown one.The characters all have potential, but I did not feel like I got to know them because the clunky first person narrative (which switched to third a few times without warning) did not flesh them out.I love a good murder mystery series, but sadly, I can't bring myself to read anything more in this series.As for the mystery itself, the author pretty much handed the killer over to the reader without a lot of suspense.  No red herrings, nothing that made me second guess myself.  There was an interesting twist at the end, which I did enjoy.I love ebooks because they give everyone a chance to have their stories heard and I appreciate the effort, but this just did not work for me.",0

"I can't believe I didn't review this book when I read it years ago.  I really did enjoy it because it was a new kind of concept for me.  If I had reviewed it years ago, I would be able to give it a more thorough and enthusiastic review, but I think people should give it a shot if they enjoy the genre.",1
It's hard to say I love this book but it does deserve 5 stars.  It is emotionally very wrenching but very educational and a must read especially  for all those who say the Holocaust is a lie.  I can't imagine surviving the atrocities of the ghetto and the camp.  Only a strong person can survive to live a normal life.  A necessary read.,1
This is the 2nd book in the series and just as entertaining as the first book. Ilook forward to reading another one.,1
"The title of this book is so appropriate.  Love is not only found in one but multiple ways.  A young man alone, struggling and nearly destitute is found by his long lost love.  In turn, his love helps him reunite with his twin sister for whom he only wished to watch from the shadows on her blessed wedding day.There is passionate energy and desire battling against entrenched bigotry and rigidity. I was completely swept away.The lovers must embrace each other and their sympathetic friends and family to triumph.  This story truly set my heart ablaze at the courage and strength of the two lovers.  It was a triumphant tale to be savored and thoroughly enjoyed.",1

"I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK.  Great love scenes, super sexy hero, yes.  I'll give you that.  Totally pathetic female who keeps pawing after him even after traumatizing humiliation years ago.  A family that treats her like crap, the male who just wants to run from her until his libido takes over, the male who hooked up with and had a long term relationship with her ""more beautiful"" evil sister, the male who called out the sister's name during sex! (granted, it was in negativity, not ecstasy), but still... the female who gave up her virginity on the dirty ground behind his truck... he never had to own up to ANYTHING he did... yes, people ""make mistakes"" when they are young, but they are ACCOUNTABLE for them!!  God, he never had to really own up to anything he said or did, past or present.  She simply chased him, finally landed him, and then that was supposed to be the beautiful ending?..... no thank you.... she should have made him really see what he lost... she totally caved and although the author tried to write her as a ""strong"" female... her actions were pathetic... sure, you could say she was determined in her shameless pursuit of him... but she pitifully let him get away with everything he'd ever done.... aarrgh!!!  Just doesn't set right with me.... I'm so bummed... because this author can write some sexy love scenes and I will still probably be curiously drawn to other books by her....",0
I do not like S/M stories and should never ordered this book.  I kept hoping story would somehow have some value but never found it. If one likes S/M this is series for them.,0
"This is the sixth book I've bought from this author, and I enjoyed all the others, including the first novel in this series.  This book, however, was a waste of money.  It lacked dramatic tension, sexual tension, or anything else that would make it worth reading.  I finished it only out of a sense of disbelief that she could write something so terrible.  Save your money and precious time - avoid this book.",0
"I am well versed in forensics and firearms .. bad guys etc.  This book was remedial, the jargon was overused and it was so implausible and predictable I simply deleted it from my Kindle.  I made a mental note not to ever read this author again.  A comic book detective would be more credible than this mess.",0
Risky Pleasures and Beyond Temptation are my favorite out of the four stories. Morgan & Cameron are passionate men. The love & steamy sex scenes in Risky Pleasures had me wanting more. I especially loved the twist at the end.,1
"It made me feel uncomfortable when I started to read it, as you note I didn't finish the book. I also don't have the book anymore.",0
"I am thoroughly annoyed with Fiona. She seems to be such a strong willed woman and yet she continuously gives in to Nikias. Every time she decides she's done, she goes back. It made me angry after the third time it happened. Also, all of the love scenes are the same. Kelly uses the same language in every scene. So much so that I skipped those parts after  a while because I knew what would happen.",0
"It's time for my first indie book review! And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet. This one is only available in ebook format, and I got mine for free, on Amazon.com.",1
I was expecting a whole lot more from this author as I have enjoyed her previous books.  This book was just too short and the characters were not developed enough.  Also I was expecting a christmas theme and the only part of christmas was that none of the characters celebrate christmas and so christmas day is just another day to them.  Hard to swallow that a con artist and a spy could immediately trust and fall into bed with each other and live happily ever after.  I was glad that I borrowed this instead of paid money for this as it was not worth either my time nor my money,0

"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora. Despite my initial hesitation about this series, I think I enjoy the world enough to read more about it!*ARC provided by publisher",1
This is a very well written book that I didn't want to put down.  I'll read more by this author.  They only minor complaint is the short section in which the font changed.  May be only in ebooks.,1
"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise,well written and tries to cover all the major international,national and domestic news stories in an easy to read, user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2. I still am reserving the 5th star for the day when technology can make Kindle incorporate graphics,comics,crossword puzzles etc;",1
This an exciting collection to read and I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it to any and all sci-fi fans out there,1
"Cassie Jordan may be newly engaged but that doesn't stop her from thinking about the two men she left behind.  That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.  One of my favorite things about this story is the differences between the men and how that plays into how she responds to each of them.  THE BOYS BACK HOME is a quick read that certainly doesn't lack for emotional impact or sexual tension.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1

"This is a sweet story covering the challenges facing a girl's unique journey to knighthood...and more. The book covers Aislinn's years from 1155 to 1169 AD.Aislinn is a determined young girl of 8 when she seeks permission to train to become a lady knight. The King agrees to a probational two year period and her work and struggles against prejudice begins. The King allows another young girl, a street ""rat"" to train too. Instead of helping each other the girls are jealous and distrustful. Unlike the other outgoing girl, Aislinn, who has some reading and math skills already, has few friends among the boys.  She is lucky to get Geoffrey, a friend of Caelan, as a mentor and Prince Caelan himself as a silent watcher/companion.As the pages grow to squires they grow closer together and Aislinn finds others to help her with the areas that she needs help with. The ""brain"" helps her with math. The stable master tries to help her when she is assigned a beautiful horse who just won't respond to the reins. She figures out that she needs to start from scratch to train Dream Rider without saddle trappings and finally she makes head way.  Aislinn even takes secret weapon training from a mysterious Shadow Warrior, Ryu.  These warriors are not trusted by either Arnhems or Speicans and had something to do with the war between the two nations.Slowly the other pages and teachers learn to respect Aislinn for her unyielding determination in tackling her challenges.  Aislinn struggles with her emotions as well as her mental and physical training. As she matures she also has to struggle with conflicting desires between her dream to be a lady knight and her growing feelings and friendship with Prince Caelan who is destined to be married for political and royal position.Prince Caelan is quiet and intense. It is clear he likes Aislinn from the beginning even if they seem to quarrel and set each other on edge. He admires her and tries to help when her stubbornness will let her accept help. But he is the Prince and is well trained to understand his duties which will include marriage as arranged by his parents. He struggles with his clear feelings for Aislinn which conflict with the duty to his position.This book is the author's debut novel. Although I feel the writing could use a little more depth, which I think will come with experience, the story concept, plot and action are sound. Also the book seemed well researched offering some interesting insight in the life of pages and squires. It is an easy going story with sweet primary characters, harsh villains, plenty of action, emotional stress, dangerous enemies, battles and magical mysteries. At the end of the book there are still open questions to be further explored in the next story in the series which I am confidant will be another lovely read.",1

I have read his other books - Samantha Moon series etc. - and I can't believe this is written by the same author. The story seems to start promisingly but quickly unravels. The characters are one dimensional and the description of their adventures seems fantastical and not credible at all. I labored to finish this book.,0
I liked the book and would read others in the series. I love paranormal and romance and good endings. A story for a quiet afternoon relaxing read. Let's see more.,1

There's not a page that isn't filled with grammar problems. The story itself suffers the same problems from the author's inattention to detail. Characters are inconsistent in their actions. It's like they're interchangeable pegs on a board the author puts into places when he needs them.",0

"The book started out ok, but it got monotonous after awhile.  I got really tired of all the bird references about flying straight, etc and then all the honor this and dishonor that.  I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. I won't go for a second.",0

"Want to know what I hate more than insta-love? No character development AND insta-love. Granted I suppose I was kind of asking for it by reading a novella that includes romance but still it's something that just makes me cringe.The author does have a fairly nice writing style and the idea overall is decent. I think if Bevill had spent more time developing the story and exploring the characters this could have been a pretty good read, but as is...it's just a rushed romance with a side of whimsy. In fact it's mostly romance after the two main characters meet, and some of it just came off as ""I'm confessing my love the second I meet you to progress the storyline quickly.""It's okay if you are looking for a short read and nothing deep but don't go into expecting too much. I'll only read the second if I ever need a quick read to fill time.",0
That one word describes everything about this book.  The plot is trite and has been done to death.  Also this author has used every trite expression that exists.  Even for free I would skip this one.,0
"I look forward to getting to the next books, and sometimes can't recall exactly what the book was about, but it is a very good book, and real good reading.'",1
I bought the kindle version of this book without reading the previous two reviews when I was bored one day. Its not worth 50 cents! And the spell check errors make parts a pain to read.,0
"This book is different, in that the main character, Hawke, is a Pianist!  The story is a simple one, and there are no subterfuges. Still I found it relaxing.",1
"This book was pretty awful. I'm glad I only spent .99 cents on it. First, it is in desperate need of editing. It went on way too long, extremely repetitive, dragging on and on about the same thing.The characters were unlikeable. I couldn't feel for any of them. The situations were unbelievable. The ending was wrapped in a pretty bow, which was not in line with the rest of the book.I am not one to not finish a book, so I couldn't wait for this to end.",0
"Good story showing the enduring quality of love despite loss, heartbreak and stubornness to let new love into your heart after loss.",1
This book had a great story line however it lacked passion and there was a lot of errors thoughout the whole book. I mean to many errors to over look.,0
"This was a good read.  The hero in the book was such a great man you can't help but fall in love with him within the first few chapters.  There is also a lot that goes on with her family and the struggles and challenges they face being part of a large family running a business.  This is a great sensual book that will keep you turning the pages until the end.  I think readers who read the ""love inspired"" books and are not to offended by some light sex scenes will enjoy this book.",1
"NOT FOR UNDER 18.  Sometimes you want to see other worlds without living them and this book is a safe place if you want to read a BDSM story.  The characters understand from the beginng what their getting into, so it's provocative. The characters are likable and plot is ok. I still enjoyed the book.",1
"I just could not get into this book and put it down after only a few chapters.  I bought the second in the series; perhaps I'll give that a try, if I have nothing else to read.",0
"Christopher Pinckley has written a step by step guide to becoming who you want to be.  The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be.  This is not as easy as it seems.  So many of us get into the flow of our lives and never really stop to analyze what it is that we want.  This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want.  The second step involves getting rid of the barriers that we all carry as baggage that prevent up from becoming what we dream of becoming and the last step involves getting to where we want to be.The author has been where most of us start.  He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become.  He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals.  Having been there, he can better guide us through these processes.The book is broken down into easy to read chapters and I was surprised at the practical exercises that he gives to make it easy to get from one step to another.  Without these concrete exercises this book might just be another ""go our and realize your dream"" books.  There is much more than that here.This book is a good read for people of all ages even if you think that you have found what you want and are already there.  Looking into our desires is a compelling and interesting exercise, no matter how old or successful we think that we are.",1
"Father Mine is a short story that is a continuation of Zsadist and Bella's story. It picks up sometime after Lover Enshrined, but going on at the same time as well.This story starts after Nalla is born, about three months after, in fact. Zsadist is still having a hard time dealing with his past as a blood slave, and it's taking a toll on his mating, and with his relationship with his daughter.This is a sweet, romantic story that I was hoping for, having finished Lover Awakened and almost feeling cheated by the ending. This book gives Bella and Z their HEA, and it really makes me love Z more. Great short story, and a must-read for any BDB fans. :)",1
Shelby Harper  and Navy SEAL John Garrett have had a rush on each other for over a year but neither has been reading the signs.  Shelby over hears Garrett talking to his best friend and she decides to make the first move.  This is a short steamy story with mature topics.

"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it. And Lord Wicked was already reformed by the time he got to her, so what's the point?",0
"From the book summary I really thought I was going to enjoy this story a lot, but sadly, I didn't enjoy it at all. The plot is full of holes and rife with inconsistencies, the story bored me to tears and it's clear from the vast amounts of grammar errors that this was a first draft which wasn't revised. I really, really wanted to enjoy this story, but from start to end I just couldn't get into it, and there were few to no explanations for most of the characters' motivations. Too much telling and too little showing, too much narrative and no character development - the list is endless. In my opinion the idea for this book has lots of potential and with the guidance of a professional editor, it can easily become a bestseller. Unfortunately, I won't be reading the rest of this series.",0
A fairly predictable plot but fun to read. I would recommend this book to people who like a quick fun read.,1
Suitable for adults and young adults. This is not a Lord of the Flies rehash. Mike and his friends are left to fend for themselves when the camp administrator and all but one counselor fail to return from a trip to the nearest town. The remaining counselor has a mental breakdown as they discover a dangerous fog trapping the coed camp of teenagers high atop a remote section of the Sierra Madras. As the group struggles to survive they learn the greatest danger to their safety may be the other humans trapped atop the mountain.,1
"The writer has some good information, but the format and editing is incomprehensible. It appears to be two books stuck together, but with a table of contents I couldn't even begin to work out what the book's structure was supposed to be.",0
"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a sucker for books set in Southern California, especially places where I either lived or visited many times. Palm Springs is in the latter category. While the opening chapter had promise, with its details of the real estate industry that ring true to me, the rest of the book was very disappointing.First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.Next, there is far too much detail about the little things in Henry's life -- the razor Henry uses, what kind of sandwich old Irma ate before she died in their Las Vegas hotel room, the list goes on and on. As another reviewer noted, this seems like padding to bring up the word count. And the author jumped around with the back story on Henry and Irma -- I thought we were through with the back story, and there it comes again, right in the middle of Henry walking around the house where the murder took place.I am glad to read that the author is going to revise this book. I hope that he tightens the action, and doesn't give us every little detail of Henry's morning rituals, etc. as though he were Marcel Proust. As to the names --- well, we are probably stuck with them....I will keep checking for the revised version, as I still am hooked on the setting, and I admire anyone who takes the time to write and publish, knowing that he or she is opening themselves up to criticism.",0
This is a short and touching story about a estranged brother at his sister's wedding falling for the groom's father after cruising each other at the hotel where they were staying. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters were so well developed is such a short span. The plot thickened! The matching was great and the story ended up being an enjoyable read.,1
"The books kept me coming back looking forward to finding out where the author was going with each character, at the same time not really wanting the book to end, even if it was predictable.",1
"Action, action, action! Equipment keeps getting blown up, but the heroes live on and on.",1
"A story of sacrifice, love, action and romance lead the characters into situations they are not prepared for to save family and pack.",1
Lots of telling and not enough showing.  Plot thin; characters without depth.  Not enough tension in the intrigue.  Just plain boring.,0
"I read the book because of all the good reviews, but it does not own up. The book is just not good. The story is boring and predictable. The main character likes a good fight... ok, now what? Seriously I feel like I got ripped off by purchasing the book and then I wasted my time reading it. You can check out my other reviews, I don't hardly ever say anything negative about a book, but this one irks me.",0
"Another one I need to add to my can't believe I waited so long to read this list. It picks up the pace quickly and moves right along until the end.Gabriel is kind of a cocky ass at times, but once you learn more about him, it is hard not to like him. He is a total wiseass and had me chuckling out loud more than once.Antonio is one hell of a sexy Spaniard. I loved his way of speaking and could almost hear that sexy accent whispering in my ear. He and Gabriel are smoking together and comploment each other perfectly.I would read more about these two any time.",1

I am re-doing an on stage production of Mark Twain and his writings. This year I was going to bring out some of his more critical views on organized religion. Captain Stormfield was just the beginning of my very convenient Kindle research.,1
"There are two stories in the volume.  The twelve chapters of the first book are called stories but they are simply chapters.  In Bulldog Drummond  movies, Bulldog usually deals with mundane matters, a murder here and there, an evil uncle trying to cheat his lovely niece of her inheritance, etc. The stories in this book, set in the 1920s,  deal with a wide spread cadre of Bolsheviks and bomb throwing anarchists whose sole purpose is to destroy English society and the bourgeoisie.  They are led by an evil mastermind whose purpose is to seek profitable gain from the resulting chaos.Hugh Bulldog Drummond is a wealthy but bored decorated soldier  of the Great War.  He places an ad in the newspapers offering his services - ""Demobilised officer finding peace incredibly tedious, would welcome diversion. ... Excitement essential.""  Soon he is contacted by a beautiful young women who says she has accidentally stumbled upon a master criminal who has power over her father.  Bulldog decides to look into the matter and soon he is up to his neck in murder, Bolshevik plots and poison dart blowing pygmies.The stories are pure pulp fiction. The hero has no problem using his strength and skills (learned in the Great War) to kill evil doers.  Bulldog may fall into the clutches of the evil doers but they either let him go with a warning or he escapes wondrously.  Bulldog and some of his friends, who he enlists for the excitement, soon set things right.  The master evil ringleader, a man called Peterson,  reappears in the second story for more  of the same.The stories are a fun read with some of the language and vernacular of 1920s England.  Bulldog presents himself as a foppish, inane lay-a-bout to the world of decent society but he is a ruthless killer to the underworld.",1

This has by far got to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read in my entire life. I used to read those Lurlene McDaniel books where the kids have terminal illnesses and this was worse. The ONLY reason I didn't give it one star is because it is well edited and had no glaring plot issues despite being worse than The Notebook on crack.,0
"I am so disappointed in this book. The over all idea was awesome, the execution however fell far too short. Horrible grammar abounds. The book changes tense over and over. The dialogue was forced as was the awkward relationship between the characters.One minute the leading man thinks the leading woman is a gold digging whatever and the next he is jumping her bones (a complete stranger to him mind you). It's like someone took all the cliches they ever read in a romance novel and strung them all together and called it a story. I won't read anything by this author again, It was just sloppy, lazy writing. So bad I could not make myself finish the story.",0
this was a good read.  I will even go so far as to say I will read it again when some time down the road. I will also seek out other books by this author.,1
"This story was good enough to make me consider giving the series a second chance. The book was still a fun clean light read. Events were more believable and it was refreshing to have Ron and Charlie work together on the case. I was even uncertain on who done it. Although the book can be read solo, this one would be better if you read a few of the others first.",1
the story was okay but a little boring.  and the writting was long and drawn out.,0

"I know all the nasty things that Linda does to Mike are supposed to be funny, but I honestly just found them tedious (oh no, it looks like Mike is wearing makeup again. . . in JAIL!).  It felt as if everybody - Mike, Linda, the gay couple next door - was just a stereotype instead of a character.  I don't know much about ghosts, but wouldn't even part of a body be sufficient for Linda's purposes?  I don't know much about killing, but who would choose that method of body disposal?You need a deft hand to make such sustained nastiness seem funny.",0
"When the F-bomb was used twice in the introduction to the book, I almost stopped reading right then.  I wish I had.  There was way too much profanity used throughout the book.  The author also needs to learn the difference between 'they're and their', 'sight and site', and 'we're and were', to name a few.  Or hire a better editor.  I stopped at 50%, and I won't read anything else by this author.",0
It was not like the in-print edition.  It was printed like a word document.  Not what I wanted.  I didn't want to pay for that.,0
IF you love good romance of any genre you must read this book.  It has everything.  A keeper for me.,1

I grew up with the old western stories. Had never read this and am glad I did.  Told through the eyes of one of  the original old timers that made the West famous.  Didn't seem to have a lot of fluff. it was just written like he may have been telling to you. Really enjoyed this.,1

"After three decades of teaching High School English, Jesse Ashworth decides to take early retirement and move back to his hometown of Bath, Maine.  His longtime friend and colleague, Rhonda Shepard, had moved to Bath a year earlier and opened a gift shop.  Business is good and Jesse divides his time between helping Rhonda at the shop, getting settled in to his new home, spending ""quality"" time with his pug, Argus, and becoming reacquainted with people he knew back in High School.  After some initial trepidation, Jesse finds that retirement suits him just fine.Just as Jesse is settling into a comfortable routine, he makes a grizzly discovery in his back yard:  the skeletal remains of a young woman who died under suspicious circumstances.  The upside?  Jesse gets to work closely with the very attractive Chief of Police, Tim Mallory.  The downside?  It doesn't take long for Jesse to come to the conclusion that someone he knows is a murderer, and that ""someone"" may just have it in for Jesse himself.This is definitely a ""cozy"" mystery, with the mystery part of the storyline taking a backseat to the characters themselves and the domestic details.  Here's what I look for in a ""cozy"":  (1)  An interesting and unique protagonist; someone I can relate to.  (2)  A strong sense of place.  I want to really get a feel for the setting; I want the location to come alive for me.  (3)  While I'm willing to give ""cozy"" writers a lot of leeway when it comes to the mystery itself, I expect it to be at least respectably plausible.  I'm happy to say that this story had a lot of what I enjoy reading in a ""cozy"" mystery.Jesse's first person narrative really worked.  He's observant and witty with a little snark thrown in for good measure.  I know this area of Maine quite well and I love it, so I really enjoyed the way the author worked ""real life"" details into his fictional story.  In fact, I have a craving for one of Amato's Italian sandwiches - Thanks a lot Mr. Stanley, there goes the diet!  Seriously, if you are familiar with Bath then you'll appreciate the details and if you're not you'll want to go there and see it for yourself.  I also really liked the  way the over 50 crowd was well represented, and (Thank You God)  not portrayed as old geezers lucky to be standing on the right side of the grass.  Nope, Jesse and company are attractive, interesting and relevant.Still, I did waffle between a 3 and 4 star rating, settling on a 3.5 (rounded up to 4 for Amazon).  While I enjoyed this very much, there's no getting around the fact that there were numerous ""typos"" - missing words, misspellings, etc - that required a bit of mental editing on my part as I was reading.  Maybe not a big deal, but anytime you are pulled out of a story -especially a Mystery - it's not a good thing.  There were a few places where the dialog could have flowed more naturally but overall I enjoyed this and plan on reading the next installment.Bottom Line:  A solid ""cozy"" mystery with good characterization and plenty of authentic atmosphere.  The mystery is serviceable, but if you're looking for plot holes, you will find them.  There are editing issues.  There is occasional strong language and while there is no sexual content, a same sex romance is depicted.  If that bothers you then this probably isn't the book for you.Book One:A Midcoast MurderBook Two:Murder in the Choir Room (A Jesse Ashworth Mystery)Book Three:The Big Boys' Detective Agency",1
I am a real fan of Sci-Fi and of Frank Herbert.  His book Dune is one of the great classics of Sci-Fi.  This story is not up to his standards.  Frankly it was like he was being paid to write a story of so many words for a magazine and he suddenly realized that he needed to finish so the story quickly and abruptly ends.The story starts off well like one of Andre Norton's space interplanetary exploration teams making first contact with a new race.  The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.  Suddenly within a few questions he solves the puzzle of where the ship is and turns the tables on his captor.  The story ends so quickly it makes you wonder why you wasted your time reading it.  It is only about 30 minutes of reading time so if you have an interest in the book then go ahead and enjoy it.  I am just glad that I didn't pay for the book.,0
I think it is a must have for anyone who is a zombie fan. The author takes  alook at a zombie apocalypse from the eyes of 9 to 5ers and does a very good job.  I commend him on his writing and would definitely recommend.,1
"A fun, suspend your beliefs, story about a kidnapping fantasy with some BDSM elements. I liked the main character - although she did continuously moan about her size. I also thought she should grow up and stop getting her sister out of jams - if she'd stop helping her I think her sister wouldn't be so bad. Enabling!The BDSM elements are good - very light compared to other stories I've read. The concept of a kidnap fantasy features in many a female's psyche (whether they want to admit it or not) and this story lets you play that out in the safety of words. The inner dialogue of the characters is very important and is done fairly well here. It seemed about the right length. Really more of a 3.5 stars but I rounded up!",1
"WELL WRITTEN AND A GREAT STORY LINE.  IT COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE INTERACTION WITH THE CREATURES OR ENTITIES FROM THE FOG, BUT OTHER THAT IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING TO READ",1
Title has nothing to do with the story.  I did enjoy it though.  Good short story about Darth Maul setting up two corporations against each other.  All in the end to help Darth Sidious' rise to power.  Won't take you long to read & it's cheap.  Go for it.,1
"I liked this book but I didn't understand what his problem was.  He never asked her to marry him when he proposed her going to England.  It was more like he wanted to continue on as they were just that he wanted her closer to hand.  Then he got all vindictive when she said no.  Crimeney!!  What was up with that?  Of course he meets up with her again and decides to seek revenge.  Um . . . for WHAT???  Because she didn't wanna be a permanent mistress?  He never said the ""M"" word let alone the ""L"" word when they knew each other before.  The man set down the rules, then decided to change them, and forgot to tell her!  Once you get past his poor me thing the book was pretty good.  Francesca and Angelo really had some chemistry and you were left rooting for the two of them.  Especially when she set aside her pride and fessed up to why she didn't think she was good enough for him.",1

"Best friends since college, Heath, Colt, and Kylie are inseparable.  They had been the three musketeers sharing everything, and still live together.  A tradition they still keep alive is Tequila Truth a game in which they promise to tell the truth and nothing but.  When they played on Heath's birthday, and Kylie revealed her desire to be with two men, both men were stunned.  Since then, none of them had been able to think about anything else.Heath and Colt had never seen Kylie in a sexual light before, but were afraid their locker room talk over the years had influenced her in ways that they were not comfortable with.  They never held anything back, and when she had to be pulled out of a sex club, they feared for her safety.  She was taking chances with her safety, and that terrified them.  Colt was horrified when he returned early from an undercover operation to find Kylie tied to her bed, and a man beating her with a belt.  It was then that he swore if Kylie Halston were adamant to experiment with sex, it would be with he and Heath!I always enjoy a story that begins with a strong base of friendship.  These three had their lives so intertwined that being together was a normal progression.  A good story, and smokin sex made this a must read!",1
"This story is a social farcical commentary on how the ongoing debate on abortion caused the US to fall into civil war. The storyline was consciously over the top describing the liberal and conservative path from public debate to public violence.  The descent from heated public discourse into mass violence was short.  The point of the author was clear, I just didn't find it very engaging.  It was political/social commentary versus a future history in the model of Harry Turtledove or Heinlein.",0

"Call me crazy but I have a hard time believing that any woman who is tied up, gagged and abused would be declaring her undying love for one of her abusers by the time they'd finished with her. If Matt is so kind, loving and crazy about Savannah then why does he let her first sexual experience be so degrading, painful and down right abusive? Really ladies is that the kind of man you would want to spend the rest of your life with? As soon as Savannah walks in to Matts boardroom and he starts to frighten her by ripping her clothes off and getting physical I found myself getting turned off by both characters. At one point Savannah is being abused by two men at once, she is crying so hard that snot is running down her face yet Matt stands there and lets them carry on. Oh yeah he's a keeper. I have to confess to skipping the rest of the book after that and just reading the end and of course it was as predictable as I expected. Savannah is lying in Matts arms begging him never to leave her and they start to plan their wedding while having the most earth shattering sex (virgins take note, your first time will not under any circumstances be that good!) ever. Ah just what every girl dreams of.",0

I am going to help the Beginners out on this one. You can get the first one for ANYWHERE from zero to 99cents. or Save even bigger dough and buy them in groups of threes1-3  4-6 7-9 get those groups and save big.Hey if you even half way think you like the sample. Then fork out the bucks and save. So many have that it seems to be the only way to fly. Unless you have a Peacekeeper car. I want one I want one Heck I just want a stack of metal and I will build my own magic flying carpet ride.Ricky has to have been born and raised in the south. That is why we have a hero with the name of Jim Bob.  No his name is not Jim Bob. It is just JIM.Still it give you a pause.On a personal basis I loved each and every one of the books in this 9 part series the action was always on the beat and the typos or mistakes were very minimal Yes I did find a few things like reading about the mans piers instead of the mans peers meaning his contemporaries. Still that does not take away from the whole experience of the reading of these great group of books. I loved them loved them loved them. It takes you from the days leading up to the Apocalypses and then to the years trying to bring about a recovery. There are starts and stops and false starts and stops Let us hope that it could be such a great help from technology.All in all you miss this series and you loose a great read and some thought provoking ideas.dray,1
"Daniel ""Duke"" Warren and Maverick ""Mav"" Holmes are roommates and teammates.  They're also opposites, and sometimes Duke drives Mav insane.  Still, they're best friends, and they'd do anything for each other.  When Duke says he doesn't have enough money to make the rent, Mav's ready and willing to help him out--until he finds out how Duke intends to get the money.  Posing for a website called Str8te Boys doesn't seem like such a good idea.  On top of that, Duke's been challenging him to play ""gay chicken,"" a game of seeing how far you can go without freaking out.  Mav's confused, but things are about to get a lot more confusing...If you've read Evangeline Anderson before, you probably have an idea of what Str8te Boys is like.  It's a quick, hot story of two guys who have always seemed straight, and what happens when they get together.  Mav and Duke are both jocks.  In a lot of ways they're typical college guys.  Their complicated relationship is revealed in bits and pieces, and I could easily see why Mav was so confused.  The sex scenes are hot, and there's a nice dose of angst.  Str8te Boys isn't terribly deep, but it's a fun, hot read that makes for a nice distraction.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
I enjoy western  with mystery and romance! This was very good story about times gone by. I love that kind of story!,1
I did not expect this type of book to be in library was pleased to find it price was right,1
"This was a well told, interesting Kindle short. It reminded me of an odd dream where everything seems real but nothing is really as it should be. There is no good way to explain the story without giving too much away (although there really is no beginning, middle, or ending, it just 'is'. )It is easy to read into where the tale is going but then, it doesn't. But that is what makes it good. It is not contrived or common.A quick and quirky tale that left me wanting to read more of Mr. Hill's work.",1
I've read several books by this author and find myself completely baffled by this poor example of her writing.  The storytelling was so simplistic that it came across as the first work of a freshman English major.  I trained FBI agent would make out with a federal judge whose life is in danger up against his car out in the open?  Story totally lacked realism.  What a waste.  Save your money.  If you like this author avoid this book.  It will sully your better memories of her writing.,0
"seriously,...equivalent to a 20 min mini porn video but on a kindle & in writing,....it wasn't worth a PENNY! I'm glad it was free and that it was oober short.",0
"I enjoyed reading this complete series of Wizard of OZ. Some books I had read before, but this is the first time I am able to read a complete set of books in order. Some books are new to me. I am currently reading this complete set.",1
"I'm not sure why some of the reviewers were so hard on this book- I wasn't expecting a great work of fiction- and it's eroticia- so my expectations weren't great.  However- this book is well written and the characters are well developed.  Unlike most eroticia- where the characters are faced with a serial killer, a stalking ex, or a bank robber (none of which ever seem all that real to me), the big issue this couples faces is realistic and typical.  Does that make for an exciting escape for the readers?  Probably not- but it felt real to me.  This was the first f/m/f book I've ever read.  I was leary of it, but it was done tastefully. I would gladly read this author again.",1
"No new ground was covered here, unless you count the fact that this domestic violence victim was rich and black. I kept waiting for something to happen.Still waiting.The ""conflicts"" of the book were laughable; Dani and Taylor can't seem to communicate or get beyond their pasts, an intruder breaks into Dani's apartment; Reggie finds her--and that scene was ridiculous; Dani's concern about how exposing Reggie will affect his parents. Oh, and let's not forget that last little Gina thing. Please.The book stretched on far too long and there were no real insights into anyone's behavior. Oh, there were explanations, but they were so implausible, they could have been made up by a 12-yr-old.Sorry, but this book was boring.",0
"I gave it 3.5/5I thought this was a great place to start the series, You get to know Kaylee a little bit and get introduced to her best friend Emma. You learn about Kaylee's abilities although you wont find out why she has those abilities until book 1. You should defiantly start here as the events that take place are mentioned throughout the entire series.",1
"""The Son of Man"" is a good read. I would call it Christian fiction.The storyline is an interesting one with many correlations to the actual biblical birth story of Jesus Christ. My only concern with this book is the pedophile priest. The priest could have been portrayed without this particular distraction and the book would not have suffered for it. It did not add anything that enhanced th story. I have no recollection of any pedophile priest in the time of the birth of Jesus.************SPOILER ALERT!**************I find it interesting how the asteroid is depicted as the guiding star at both birth instances. I would not have thought it would have been in the Earth's atmosphere for enough time to act as a guide, especially moving at 16,000 miles per hour.Still a good read and given the cloning aspects not exactly in the realm of science fiction.",1
"What I like about this book, is that it's full of elfs and dragons. The main character and her friends are bullied by two elfs known as the evil twins. The ending was quite nice, and there is even part of the next book at the end, along with some other things, like a glossary for an example.",1
Great 2 nd book in the series- Marc and Kelly are true mates and Lissa vision come true in this follow up book,1
"This Very Moment is an easy, relaxed read with strong religious overtones. It is an inspirational story with likeable characters struggling to cope with the difficult realities of grief and lost love. It speaks to the heart about hope, love, and new beginnings.This book was just luke warm, althought it does have a slight crescendo of suspense at the end. It's a story of a sweet love that unfolds into a predictable, but satisfying conclusion. I just wasn't able to stay engaged with the characters and the story, skimming through some of the chapters. My rating is 2.5 stars.",0
A whole lot of sappy with a plot that could have been better.  More like a fantasy day dream that just didn't quite make it to the finish line.,0
"This is an awesome book!! You are quickly thrown in the mix of "" the life"", learning how to deal with real life situations from a street mentality point of view.",1
"This book is hilarious! As a person on the staff of a psychocat (Oscar) I find myself answering mine in the same way and wondering if he is thinking the same things that Max does. Now the question is ""Which one of us really needs therapy - me or the cat?"" Max and Oscar make me wonder if its me. I am the one who obviously can't be trained to do this the right way, especially feeding him on demand and catering to his every whim. But I think now that I have clues to the working mind of a cat, I have hope for myself.",1
"Very interesting ideas. Shades of Soylent Green, one of my favorites. The book forces one to think about both sides of an issue we all think about uncomfortably. I personally thought the ending was great!",1
"Not very well written, and the sex scenes were just NOT good.  Book/Story did not flow at all.  Felt like a ""cut and paste"" story.",0
I have yet to be disappointed by Ms. Andrews.  I enjoyed this world and its sister story silver shark.  Mostly because I like reading a series of connected stories that tie in with each others characters and worlds.,1
I'm glad I decided to buy the bundle and honestly I wasn't surprised it was good. I cannot decide which story was better. They were all full of action from beginning to end. I realize these stories were written in 2008 but I didn't care. The author knows how to pull the characters out and the dialogue was not immature. Do I recommend the book absolutely.,1
I could not even get past the second chapter.  I like young adult books as they by-pass all the sex scenes.  This one just didn't make sense to me.,0
"I am crazy about this book!  I had read ""Drawn Together"" shortly before this and really loved it, so wanted to read another book by this writer.  I think this one is even better!  The story was quite moving and I loved the way so many different kinds of trust issues were explored. I loved the main male characters, Jae, Kelly and Will, & the complexity with which each character was drawn:  Kelly struggling with all his fears and uncertainty who at the same time was a very brave and loving man, Jae struggling with his conscience over issues of personal honesty and changing feelings about his line of work, and Will, struggling to recover from a past that has left him emotionally damaged and to learn to let go of the safe haven he's found with Kelly.  Also LOVE the physical descriptions of the characters, particularly Jae! A 6'5"" gorgeous Asian man ""built like a tree trunk"" with a braid of long dark hair as thick as a man's wrist that hangs to his @ss - Oooh La La!!!  (I notice the writer seems to have, like me, a bit of a ""thing"" about hot Asian guys with long hair in a braid, as there was a character like this in ""Drawn Together"" too - Love It!)",1
"I'm having trouble reading this, it is so silly.  For example, the lead character meets his new partner (female) in the morning, assigns her a boring reading detail, and later that night when he arrives at a scene where she has been an undercover decoy, says about her eyes, ""They were radiant, energetic brown pools.  Lately, they had been hypnotic and lingering.""  He has known this woman for about 12 hours at this point, and been apart from her for the past several.  There is no ""lately"" involved in this time frame!  How stupid!  For the life of me, I don't know how this book has gotten any good reviews; it is just awful.  I have a morbid fascination to see how much worse it can get, but not sure I can stick it out to the end.",0
I have read three of his books and found them all very good.  Interesting and full of action.  I will most likely read others by him.,1
"Firstly I love the cover. Very hot!But in regards to the story - this a type of paranormal book or fantasy world if you like. I wish I knew that before downloading. I hate those types of books. I just find them completely unrealistic. This book held promises of a great sensual romance then when I cottoned onto what was involved I just lost my interest in it. If fantasy worlds are you thing by all means read this but if you like a bit more ""reality"" don't bother.",0
This was an enjoyable surprise and a very entertaining read. The story unfolded revealing little clues as we began to perhaps guess what may have caused Alexi's disappearance. Some red herrings and suspicious characters made this a satisfying mystery as well as a fantasy. I enjoyed the fact that Miranda's character as a normal middle aged woman trying to solve a very strange mystery was very believable. In general I found the book was unput-downable! I started reading last night and unfortunately for the huge pile of washing that needs folding... didn't put it down this morning until I had finished. Well worth the modest Kindle purchase price.,1
"This was surprisingly good. Although the plot was incredulous, the characters were more realistic than most; their dialogue was relatable  and the conversation was not pretentious. They communicated their feelings n I like that the h was outspoken. What I also liked was that the h's character was consistent; observations were made about her character by her father early in the story so it was easy to follow her behaviour or treatment towards the H. I loved this book.",1
"I love a good highland story and have read a few in this series. A bit slow in some parts, but still a great read. Several of the chapters in my copy, had unfinished sentences at the end of each chapter, but was able to figure out missing words. Enjoy.",1
"I won't lie, the first few chapters are hard to get into....or at least it was for me. But by the time I got to chapter 4 I was so riveted that I couldn't put the book down. It sort of boggled my mind to know that any woman could ever forgive a husband that had married her, when he already had a family two states away. And what's even worse... then she moves to that same city where the other family lives, so her children can still be close to their dad. I have to tell you...that just blew my mind. Then it gets better yet, because this woman's brother is the one that ratted him out, and now her own brother is married to her ex-husband's, Kevin's, first wife. And what's even more weird, is that both of his ex-wives become best friends in the process. In fact they all seem to get along, both the children and the adults. I still really don't know how she did it, but....the Brenda Novak had a way of weaving this story around so well, that it really makes this story work some how.Like I said...there are so many major twists and turns in this story, that by the time I finished reading it, I thought I'd surely have a bad case of whiplash. LOL!Stories that involve adultery usually isn't my kind of thing, but this story really hooked me for some odd reason.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!! Most definitely.",1
"I had always wanted to read the Apocrypha and was glad to find it on my Kindle.  Being a Christian, I have read the Bible through several times, but was always curious about these &#34;missing&#34; books.  After reading this it is easy to see why these books were not included in the scriptural canon.  However, they do provide some historical information about ancient religion.  I especially appreciated the background information given before each book.  I personally would recommend that anyone who reads this would read the entire Bible first.  It will make more sense to you then.",1
What a difference life was when this book was written.  The author gives such great details of the events then,1
"This was a good novella to introduce readers to the Angels series. However, it's not necessary to read this before reading Angel's Blood. The plot and pacing were good, and the character development was great. The tension between the hero and heroine was one of the best aspects of the story. Due to the short word count, the storyline and backstory didn't have as much time to develop as I would've liked. I think  I may enjoy it better as a reread since I've finished Angel's Blood now and understand more of the backstory. Overall, a good read.",1
"this is the fifth book in bianca d'arc's dragon seriesi loved this story, the characters were amazing as to be expectedi love this series and would highly recommend it to anybody",1
"I read A Helping Hand and had some problems with it but loved the character of Jeremy, and when I heard he had his own book,  I downloaded it immediately.  I was so disappointed with what I felt was a waste of a really good character.  Here is was just some generic and improbable love story,  and a repetition of the theme of Helping Hand - acknowledged gay man falling for 'straight' man.  I thought Jeremy deserved better and the whole plot twist - who was shooting at David and why,  didn't work for me either.  Silly plot and weak characterizations - could have been so much better.  In the end I had it deleted from my Kindle...",0
"I'VE NEVER WRITTEN A BAD REVIEW THAT I CAN REMEMBER ALTHOUGH SOME DESERVED IT.  WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK I THOUGHT IT SOUNDS WORTHWHILE TO SPRIN FOR .99.  WRONG.  WHEN I READ WHERE SOME SAID THEY COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, I THOUGHT HOW I WISH THE END WOULD COME SOONER THAN LATER.  THIS BOOK WAS SO POORLY WRITTEN THAT IT DOESN'T DESERVE BEING ON AMAZON ALTHOUGH SOME DISAGREE WITH ME OBVIOUSLY.  HOW DID I DESPISE IT, LET ME COUNT THE WAYS.  IT WAS HORRIBLE.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND .99.  IF I WASN'T OLD AND RETIRED, I WOULD BE REALLY UPSET FOR WASTING MY TIME BUT THAT'S WHAT I HAVE MOST OF NOW.  AN RANK AMATEUR COULD WRITE THIS BOOK.  THE PLOT WAS SO PREDICTABLE AND THE REST WAS JUST PURE JUNK.",0
"I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy.  I did not manage to finish this book.  I found it slow starting, clunky, and the characters were not engaging enough.  The first chapter was fine, but after that, it just went down hill.  The book switches narrator from character to character and doesn't give you enough time to know who everyone is before it moves to the next point of view.  The author shows promise, and I would give him another try in the future, but this book was not for me.",0
"I can see Gena's writing improving with her books, but Ive read several and find myself frustrated with the lack of an imaginative story line behind all the adult scenes and foreplay.She writes what she feels shes good at, but for me I dont think I can get into her series the way other people can. Theres a decided lack of character development. Theres not a strong story line. Theres the hero and heroine, theres the angst that draws them together while pushing them part. Theres the climax of the story that leads you to believe that for now all is well. As for the rest it goes from mild story scene to tons of adult content and not much else. It seems like the mild story scenes get you from one adult scene to the next. If you are all about paranormal Adult romance this is for you. If you want a story that is more story and shows the complexity of the characters its not for you.Sorry Gena. This is not my cup of tea.",0
"London, 1817It's time for another meeting of the BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"I actually really liked this story, but of course I'm somewhat biased since I love Ms. Vaughn's books.  Even though I felt that the heroine was a total doormat to everyone in her office, the hero and even her live-in cousin, I think she finally redeemed herself at the end. Love the inner dialogue as well when the heroine tells off certain people in her office.  Sometimes I'm thinking the same thing when people are intruding upon my work time as well.  Recommended read.",1
There is plenty of action and some interesting characters. I will probably read more of this author.  The love story is also realistic which shows good writing for this short a story.,1
I will look for more books from this author. I hope to find more books from the author. I will read this book again,1
"This was an amazing story, you are really drawn in. The character development is well done. I highly recommend this series. As of this writing there are nine books in the series. It will be well worth the price . Once you start you will not want to stop, the plot is addictive. Don't say you were not warned. Enjoy.",1
"Based on the excellent reviews, I decided to get this book. The beginning was promising, although shallow. But, shortly into the story in turned into someone's erotic, but sadistic fantasy. I was not sure, so skipped ahead and did not get any better. I was so offended by the tenet in the writing, that I has to stop reading. I am not a prude and have read erotic novels, but the sadistic allusions were just beyond me.",0
"Had to look up in the dictionary a lot of words.  Written in English Victorian language, this book was fun to read.  They can not say three words when 23 words would suffice.  Very good mysteries and well proven.Tv",1
"I struggled through this book. It has a very nice stopryline but the manner in which &#34;Tessa&#34; is provide through italics, I found boring. I skipped through these sections and still had a firm grasp of the storyline. This book disappointed me as I enjoyed many other offerings by this author. I hope that she will redeem herself in my eyes.",0
"Boring story, and even though it was short, I still skipped through parts to get to the ending, which was very lame.  Only good thing about story was that it was short and it was free.",0
I enjoyed this book but was a little disappointed in the abrupt ending.  I just found out there is a sequel and I am definitely going to try and find it to read.,1
"Gage Warren harbors a serious crush for the sexy woman watching him. Hailey Jennison is the only reason he parades around his apartment once-a-week giving the women across the quad a show. He's asked around about her and knows she's infamous at turning down dates. Gage's desperation leads him to blackmail her into a date. He's sweet, but he's no charmer. Instead, his directness is a huge turn-on!Hailey has tried for years to get people to look past her playmate body to the capable woman -- with brains! -- within.  She's alienated herself with her standoffish attitude.  But once Gage comes into the picture, she completely blooms.It's a quick read, but so worth it!",1
"Pretty decent.  Easy read.  Just confirmed some things I already knew.  Good go to book.  Not overly technical, but just enough to grab concepts and make your shot work.",1
"Our favorite gay medium, Vic Bayne, returns in the 2nd installment of the Psycop series. Unwilling to go back to his apartment where the incubus almost killed him and was turned into a mass of protoplasm (""Among the Living"", the first novel), Jacob has moved in with Vic and both are testing the waters of cohabitation. In each character's mind, they realize this may or may not be temporary as neither has broached the subject of actually living together. Vic's friend Lisa is now in training at PsyTrain, and he has been assigned a new partner, Roger Burke, a rather affable eager-to-please who accepts Vic and his sexuality all in stride. This all seems well enough, and things should be going well for Vic, except that his psychic ability has gone into hyperactive mode. The dead are now clearly visible everywhere, and they seek him out when he's around. Constantly reaching for him, he can actually physically feel them and starts to lose control and break down.It's a very enjoyable story. Vic is a wonderfully complex character, and his sarcastic wit gives the story a lighter edge when needed. As with any good story, Vic undergoes some growth, which adds to the empathy one can feel for him. Too many serial stories don't let their characters grow, trying to keep them the same as they were in the first book, so it's pleasant when you can see and chart the growth Vic is gradually going through. Other characters aren't quite as fleshed out as Vic is, but they're still interesting and enjoyable. The story stumbles a little at times by stretching plausibility (like the introduction of a device that lets Vic tune in or tune out spirits, which raises more questions as to the nature of the spirits than it answers), but overall, it's an immensely interesting and enjoyable novel.",1
"Talk about scary and suspenseful. This short story had my attention until the very end, and I must say I would have kept reading had there been more! Very suspenseful and scary. I love this author who also wrote Serial, and the Jack Daniel's series. I will be wary of the next truck stop I pass through!",1
"I have to admit that I enjoyed ""Thief"" far more than I expected, and it certainly isn't like another other mystery or sci-fi story I've ever read. It sucked me right in and all the way through to the end! I agree with other reviewers that it is of excellent quality.There were some typos and the like that were noticeable, but, unlike other books I've read, they didn't annoy me to the point that I had to get away from the book. It was hard to put down indeed! In fact, I just jacked up the font size on my Kindle and kept going as I got more and more tired.Now I have to go buy the author'sExecutive Lunch (A Sedona O'Hala Mystery)since the preview in ""Thief"" has sucked me into that one, too. Good thing I already have herSage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom, which is also previewed in ""Thief.""",1
"I was originally going to give this book only 4 stars becausegetting through the first few chapters was painfully difficult...I felt the whole Kerri begging Mitch to find her a husband was alittle stupid BUT.....Then everything changed....What a wonderfully fun,super sexy,emotionally packed story!!!!I just might start doing Yoga again  : )",1
As I found with many of Shiloh Walker's kindle books they are short. If you see a low price on one of her books it's probably because it isn't a full length novel. Candy Houses is the 1st in the Grimm Circle series. As with ALL of Shiloh Walker's books you won't be diappointed.,1
Great sex and a decent plot although not too shocking as to who dun it. A little body painting might have been fun.,1
"For some reason I have the impression that Geena has changed editors. I have read many of her books, but this one is not remotely like the ones I used to like. The way she writes is sloppy with unusual indifferent lines. The story is short and is hardly a story at all. I must agree with another reviewer who 'finds herself frustrated with the lack of an imaginative story line behind all the adult scenes and foreplay.'I must give it 'only' a two star because the 5star reviews are deceptive for someone searching for a good book. I know Geena can do a lot better than this.",0
"This was a lovely story! After 10 years of not seeing each other because of what happened, James and Lorna found each other again. I was really happy for them and their miracle. God was her God too despite what her father said..... loved that!",1
I had read all these years ago.  I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago.  I got caught up again.  I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them.  I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out.  This series does not disappoint.  It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer.  It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment.  I highly recommend.,1
"Guy decides to go through the center of the earth with a couple friends.Interesting... until you realize how utterly impossible it is... I mean, riding up out of the center on a volcano? Hellloooo?

"PLOT: Stacy is lonely and decides to make a pass at Nash, an attractive wolf shifter. She's annoyed when he turns her down. Nash is attracted to Stacy, but he doesn't want to lose his position as pack leader by chosing a human as his mate.PROS: I thought Nash and Stacy were likeable and sounded attractive. The story begins very well.CONS: I had a hard time respecting Nash and Stacy. Both of them made so many poor decisions that were stupid and born out of obstinance. I actually found this story to be depressing. I believed that Nash and Stacy were hot for each other. I don't think they knew each other enough to love each other. That Stacy knows that Nash and his friends are werewolves contradicts the original story where her friend is told that if she tells anyone, she will be killed. At the end, the author skips two years. After this, two important characters are brought up, but neither of them are given names. (I can't give away who they are without giving away key plot points.) Alphons actions at the end of the book seemed unlikely and pointless. The ending was abrupt. An epilogue would have been nice.2 STARS: I'd been looking forward to this one since the series seemed to be improving as it went along. I think this is the worst in the series.",0
Wow! That's about all I can say about Seducing Jane Porter. The whole power play between the submissive and the dominant was very well done. I tend to download free books and have realistic expectations. This book exceeded my expectations and I would read more by its author.,1
"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful, but she is strong, compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate, but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in, but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love, hate, romance and philanthropy.",1
"I read this book hoping and praying that the author had addressed the serious informational errors that had occurred in the first bookS.E.A.L. Team Omega Flames of Betrayal. I was sadly let down.The author clearly has no clue about the lifestyle/environment/mentality of the military & its personnel.Not only is the heroine the leader of a mercenary group (which could happen) she is also co-leader of a SEAL Team. (Not gonna happen. Military units have a chain of command and only ONE leader ever.) Oh and she's not American, she is British.Now in this book, on top of all of that, she suddenly becomes the creator & head of a Japanese Ninja clan. SAY WHAT?I have lived in Japan. I lived there for three years. They are a very patriarchal and semi xenophobic society. There is NO WAY a non-Japanese woman is going to be able to create and lead the ""purportedly"" toughest ninja clan in Japan.Sierra Rose, GO back to writing paranormal romance novels where you shine. Stay out of military novels. You don't have the knowledge base to make them at all believable.",0

"This second book in the series was just as good as the first, with great characters and interesting story.This book cleverly overlaps in time with the first book, Secret Desires, showing the same scenes but with a different perspective. This is the story of Gregory and Ryland who have known they are destined to be mates and have known since they first met years ago. Gregory has been waiting for Ryland to 'grow up' and now that he is over eighteen, Ryland can't understand why Gregory won't claim him.When they finally get together after some initial misunderstandings, it is hot and sizzling. The relationship starts with a bang and from that time forward the two men are all over each. Ryland is totally inexperienced and has been pining over Gregory and Gregory hasn't had sex for 6 years so they are very passionate!Once again not fully understanding the implications of the tri-omega causes problems and suddenly Ryland's life is at risk. Luckily the third mate for the relationship is discovered. Viktor immediately recognises Ryland as he mate but Gregory's prior claiming causes a few concerns but nothing Viktor and Gregory's attraction to each other can't resolve. And luckily Leyland, Lucas and Jake are able to share some more insight into the whole tri-omega workings. ""You know, it would have been really nice if someone had explained all of this to us in the very beginning. Maybe you should think about publishing a f***ing how-to manual,"" Gregory yelled before slamming the phone down.Once again, this is a fun book with great characters and lots of humour. There are some minor editing problems including the odd changing of a minor characters name, noticed but easily overlooked.",1
"As far as mysteries or thrillers go, this was a dud. It lacked any suspense. It was a simple story of a wife's revenge on her unfaithful husband, a plot that has been done over many times.",0
The classics never go out of style. Sherlock and Watson are not exceptions. These stories are as fresh today as they were when I read them as a child.,1
"The book begins when Morgan, a small town doctor, meets Luke, a drifter with a baby. The baby is the result of a random one-night stand with a waitress/prostitute, and has been left in Luke's care. Morgan, knowing nothing about Luke, invites both he and the baby back to his derelict farm. From there, the author pieced together several random scenes where Morgan and Luke interact, yet there is no character development, and no real sense that these characters are building a connection.Luke is not gay, and Morgan just wanders around the farm ogling him. Basically, Luke just decides to let Morgan kiss/touch him, and boom, they're messing around. Luke had no real personal dilemma or journey to this conclusion. The sex scenes seemed to be written by someone who doesn't actually know how gay men have sex.Overall, this ""novel"" was so poorly crafted - all I can say is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0
"This book should be removed, only one page and it says ""this title is out of print"" - so don't bother downloading it.",0
"I've read and liked a few stories from this author, but this series should be re-done completely for the ridiculous un-readable dialog that she strapped the O'Hagan family with. Her attempt to write characters with an Irish brogue is laughable (and not in the positive tickle your funnybone kind of way). My best friend (who is Irish by the way)said that it was by far the WORST representation of the Irish accent... and I had to agree.  Although I liked a few of her other books, this one is a complete let down. The idea was good; the only thing(s)dragging this story down is the dialog and the poor editing (which seem to be a problem in quite a few of her books). You are distracted by the type-os, and it just makes the writing appear rushed and sloppy--which I am sure is not the case.Maybe if she re-did and re-released this series, sans the Irish brogue....*I have the same review for all the books in the O'Hagan series.",0
This book was very interesting and has a great plot.  The characters are complex without being hard to follow.  I had to read the the rest of the books in this great story.,1
"I was happy to get Bevyn' s story, since it happened before book one. The other characters were well written and I could just like fire their little town in my mind. I enjoyed the backstory, since it adds more bits and pieces that might be useful in another book.",1
"THIS WAS A CUTE STORY. GOOD PLOT, INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND AN INTERESTING ENDING. GOOD TRUE TO LIFE STORY, ABOUT LUSK AND LOVE, A GOOD ROMANCE NOVEL. IT HAS IT'S INTERESTING MOMENTS, IN THIS BOOK, SO DON'T GIVE UP AND KEEP READING!ELLIE MILLING, DIAMOND SPRINGS, CA.",1
The first thrd of this book is taken up by very lengthy discussions of  technology and maths.  I could not get a hold of the hero at all.  He did not capture me and I could not identify with him. He was a techie and was naive and shallow and had a teenager outlook.  This is fine as he has spent his whole adult life cooped up with a smart computer and his maths problems.  However he just didn't cut it for me as the hero.  I found him frustrating.  The next books in the series are not so fixated on the technology and IMO are better for it.  PS the author replied to my review and so I encourage readers to write as he seems to care about what readers think,0
"This novel seems to have gone unedited - not even an MSWord grammar check.  Inconsistencies abound (slides a clip into a revolver; buys some fries and then tosses the empty donut bag into the trash, et al.).  Hyperbolic prose that REALLY needs trimming.  I will give the rough outline of the plot a decent score but in the telling, it gets muddled.  Too many Nancy Drew moments for grown-up fiction.  Also, the general tone is a ""dark and stormy night.""  A theme - small towns have bad things going on under the otherwise placid surface - is not a bad way to go, but elements of the story (the porn, Bobby Lee, et al.) get introduced and then go unresolved.  For 99 cents, fine.",0
Bella Andre shares an amazing trio of stories about three best friends' surrender to love during a weekend trip to the Napa Valley wine country. Each story was individual as each character. Yet the stories spoke to a need we each have for a love designed to satisfy our individual heart's desire. Carrie and Tyson. Rose and Jack. Vanessa and Sam. You should read this book for yourself and determine which comes closet to resembling your own story or the one you long for. Hmm good.,1
"Bait to buy?This ""book/short"" is really just a full blown ad for his other book.Chapter one starts 10% into the ""book"" - after 10% of reviews for Beyond Justice.  Then this ""tale"" goes to the 49% mark.  With the last 50% dedicated to an excerpt os BJ.  Well, after a brief word from the ""sponser"" (author).The meager 39% dedicated to the ""hero"" is a TELL - nothing shown.  Though with the length I suppose there was no alternative for the writer.When I got this a while ago, it was not listed in Christian.  The one sentence description says ""redemption"" - but in a mystery /thriller (which this is listed under genre wise) that could hold meaning other than someone finding God.  It is not uncommon for teasers and word play - rather than literal intrepretation in such genre.  So, I was not expecting such a Christian heavy work.  That said, it was fine once I realized the case.  However, that is precicely what ruined the book as it became predictably obvious after the first Bible verse.  It is unfortunate as mysteries /thriller's should have some - well - mystery OR thrill.  None of either found here.But, the thing most frustrating is that this work was really just an offering to push another (more pricey) book.  While authors often push other works in some other novel - they do NOT devote 60% to that other book.There are a few punctuation errors and a couple word use issues - but was well edited.I won't try another from this author as I can buy a magazine if I want to read ads.Christine",0
"This is a very quick and easy read. The story is engaging and well written. The characters are real and the story line believable enough for a lovely story. If the book description catches your interest, reading the book should too.",1
"I am about 1/2 way thru the book. It is short, but it is very hot!! I enjoyed it though.",1
A very interesting but very short story.  I am looking forward to reading  more of Steve Berry's.  The future meeting of these characters should be great.,0
"First of all the back description throws you off a bit and the book went in another direction I didnt expect which was a disappointment. Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset. And I was left wondering whatever happened to the children of the duke? why bring them in the tale if you hardly mention them? The hero/heroine were likeable but not enough to save this book.",0
"I wanted to like this book.  I must say I loved the book cover, but the ef bomb and all the sexual stuff that really didn't fit in anywhere just turned me off.  It probably had a good plot, but I have to say I dropped it at 41%.  Really needs work.",0
"I was surprised to find myself learning so much about history while being bombarded with the wit and humor that is so characteristic of Mark Twain. I am fascinated with the clever way he clues the reader as to the accuracy of the various parts of his writing by attributing the ridiculous and hilarious stuff to some other character, and then making sure the reader knows of the departure from the truth by insinuating that he doubts the veracity of their story.Even so, as with all of Twain's work, it is imperative that all of his writing be taken with a ""grain of salt"", and a reader's ability to separate the facetious, from the facts. For example, I remember a story in which he makes derogatory statements about an Indian standing out in the snow and watching the author eat a nice hot meal through the window of a warm and luxurious restaurant. Some people have actually been turned off of Mark Twain because they did not realize that this was his way of illustrating the inherent injustice of the scenario. Having yet to revisit that particular story, I look forward to reading once again, what I have always considered to be an excellent and heart-felt illustration of compassion on his part.Mark Twain's writing seems simple, but he is quick and clever in his presentations and has a remarkable command of the language. So if you are up to matching wits with him, I heartily recommend his work, and in particular this large collection.",1
"How does a wizard who has taken an Oath of Magical Non-Violence protect his household and his village in dangerous times?  Wistril, cranky and reclusive, undertakes to do just that in this lighthearted collection.  ""Stealth and guile may win"", he instructs Kern, his sarcastic and dubious apprentice, ""where fury and might may not.""Kern and major-domo goblin Sir Knobby; with a miscellaneous staff of goblins, phantoms, and magical creatures more or less real, are responsible for carrying out the often apparently lame-brained instructions of their irascible master. Anything from nurturing orphaned sea monsters to learning the correct cutlery arrangement for an Oomish engagement party to undermining the underpinnings of a bridge may be required of them at any time.Kern's adolescent snark is authentic and well done, and Wistril has some great lines, (""The Oath prohibits offensive arcane actions, not malicious carpentry""); but his character could use a bit more development - rounding out as well as rotundity.  The dialogue throughout is very good, and the stories well paced.4   Stars. There were just a few editing errors that kept me from giving this book 5 stars, but more Wistril stories would be very welcome.Rated G - readers 8 to 80+ can enjoy this book.",1
This is a great period story! 1835 was turbulent for Texas and the beginnings of the debate over slavery. Once again the characters are exciting and comical. We love Miranda!.and all the others. #2 in the trilogy,1
"My Lady Compelled is the first book in The Archangels series. It's a series of 6 erotic historical romance books that take place in the Regency era. The Archangels group consist of 6 men who helped England by spying on the French.The book starts off with Lord St. John having a ""wives sale"". His wife, Lady Gabriella St. John is barren and he sees no need to have her anymore as his wife. Lord Drummond Penhurst, the Duke of Kitteridge hears of this sale and names his price. Lord Drummond has always been attracted to Lady Gabriella. He thinks by taking her as his wife he can teach her how to pleasure a man properly. Little does he know Lady Gabriella has never seen a man naked or what to do with one even though she's been married for 25 years. Lord Drummond wins the sale and starts his mission off by pleasuring Lady Gabriella three times. Lady Gabriella is in shambles after that. She has never felt or experienced anything so unbelievable in her life. She figures since she was bought and paid for that she now needs to do what he said, especially after he brought her to climax and donned her in diamonds.If you want a fast historical very erotic read, then this book is for you. The story line wasn't that strong but that didn't bother me while reading this book. I wanted a hot steamy erotic romance and that is exactly what I got. I did enjoy it and I plan to read the rest.[...]",1
A good story line. I like the dragonriders theme to it. It is definatly an erotic book that has some pretty kinky stuff. I'm thinking about checking out other books in the series.,1
"Tidal Wave by Vivian Arend*I won this book from a contest by the author*Tidal Wave is set in the small seaside town of Jaffrey's Cove where the majority of the residents are merfolk. Alexia's grandmother is the leader of the pod but she's tired and ready to pass the task on to Alexia.  She gives her a beautiful necklace but doesn't reveal the medallion's secrets to Alexia.Alexia has spent her summers in Jaffrey's cove for years and has always felt connected to it.  Now she is back to help her grandmother get settled into a new home.  She is drawn to the sea but doesn't understand its call.  She has been having dreams for years of a young boy she met her first summer there, Joshua but now he's all grown up.Joshua has been in love with Alexia since she agreed to let him kiss her.  After that summer, he was sent away when she would come to visit.  Now he is grown up and determined to make Alexia his.One night during a storm, Alexia is drawn to the ocean and a chain of events is set off that can't be stopped.Alexia is confused and hurt when she finds out the secret of the necklace and what her role in the future of Jaffrey's Cove will be.  She can't believe her gram has kept this secret from her all these years.  She is shocked by her behavior with Joshua and Anthony.  She is drawn to them and can't walk away from either one.Joshua knows what he wants and intends to go after it.  Everyone discounted him because he kept to himself but what they didn't realize was he was biding his time until Alexia returned.  Anthony is the quite one, the peace maker.  He had no plans of helping rule the pod, until he met Alexia and all plans changed.I love the interaction between the main characters.  I am proud of Alexia for handling Michael when he forced himself on her.  Gram is one of my favorite characters.  She has a lot of spunk and doesn't take no for an answer.  She is proud of Alexia and doesn't want her to feel embarrassed or ashamed for the way she is feeling.Tidal Wave pulled me in from the moment I picked it up.  The story flowed effortlessly with a great plot and smoking hot sex scenes.  I read it in one sitting and can't wait for Whirlpool to come out.  I give Tidal Wave 4 flaming hearts.",1
"A competent thriller that succeeds on most levels. It's economically written, authoritative about newspaper newsrooms and statehouse journalism, and its characters are skillfully drawn (if slightly cliched; does every newsroom in fiction have an alcoholic burnout of a onetime star reporter on his last chance?).The clockspring tension and suspense is well-developed, though the moralizing about the rapacious nature of news reportage goes a bit over the top. The reveal of the killer, which offers a clever twist on real Harrisburg history (look up R. Budd Dwyer for a look at the true horror story than inspired ""Kill The Story""), leads to a delicious doozy of a climactic scene.My only real complaint, as another reviewer here aptly pointed out, is that there is no way the reader could have guessed the identity of the killer before the big reveal. That made the reveal less of a powerhouse moment then it could have and should have been, and made the ponderous exercise of piecing together the connection between the murder victims to that point into an elaborate jerk-around at the readers' expense.Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the text contained more typos and other careless errors than should ever have come from a self-respecting journalist (which the author obviously was at one time). It just goes to show that every writer needs a strong copy editor.All in all, however, ""Kill The Story"" is a reasonably well-crafted thriller that largely delivers on its intriguing premise. I'll definitely check out more of John Luciew's work.",1
I love the billionaire series especially Europians.  I watch for Cathy Williams work.  I really enjoy her work.  If anyone remembers the old stories love her work.  Keep it up Cathy I'm watching.,1
"Meaning I read it from start to finish, you guessed it, in one sitting. It doesn't happen very often. The storyline has to be really good. The characters have to be really engaging, or even lovable. I can't be able to figure everything out, at least til near the end. And almost as important as the rest, I need to get a laugh out of it once in a while. This book fit all those criteria in spades.Jim Richards, our good guy, is sarcastic and smart, about some stuff. The rest of the cast of characters range from the scruffy to to the TV personality. The narrative style speeds the story along with enough plot twists to keep you guessing. In other words, I really loved this book!",1
"Feel good romance about a down on his luck bookseller and a tourist selling the rarest of Dickens books. Prose is lovely - smooth, rich, vibrant without being over the top. Hot scenes with Lanyon are always hot and male and no funny strange words or odd moments that were not supposed to be there. I agree with Segwick when he says James is confident about sex - in general that's what comes off in Lanyon's books I've read so far - the scenes are part of the story, an extension of the character and the plot - not an extra thrown in to qualify for erotic. I did have a bit of a hard time getting into this one. Of course the parallel's to Christmas Carol are here and welcomed.",1
"I enjoyed read books by Maya Banks, they have good storylines and characters are very loveable. In this story we see how Emily cope with lost of her husband and love for Donovan brothers. A good read and would tell my friends.",1
Fascinating truths of an Age misunderstood by so many.  I hope the author would be proud of the heritage that has finally produced a President!,1
"From [...]I have never before read a book like Steve Peek's Long Claws.It is a thriller and a horror story. The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, ""Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn."" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang. Do not put it down if you are not hooked by the first five pages. You will not be disappointed if you continue the story to its conclusion.",1
I have enjoyed the characters and plots in every Elaine Overton book I have read so far and this is no exception.  Very Good read!,1
"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.",1
Just what I expected I enjoyed the read.  I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren't needed it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote.,1

"So, he believed the worst of her continuously!! No matter that she was always proven to have said NOTHING but the truth, he always thought she was lying the next time. It was ridiculous. Let's not forget that after he believed the worst about her and ditched her and his brother for 6 months, he admits to sleeping with other women to get the heroine out of his mind. WOW!! What a man!!! She was miserable and talked bad about by him and he thinks he has the right to go on with his life while ruining everyone around him!! I do understand it better once he said that he had her checked on every few days to keep tabs on her and when the pictures of her and her therapist (he only say her hugging on a strange man repeatedly) came back to him, I think he thought she moved on and figured he should to. It never states whether he slept with the other women before that point or after. I would like him better if it was after but he still gets no points for personality!!!! I want to know what the test was that Alexis did to Daryle to make her think he only wanted her as a mistress. He showed up at the airport apologizing for hurting her but saying it was only to test her feelings and there was never anything else about it. What did he do to hurt her so badly and make her cry like that???? I would not read this book again!",0
"the characters were flat and undeveloped, it seemed like the writer was trying for 2 books, one a disaster book and one a soap opera romance with the obligatory sex scene to spice things up.  the beginning started off pretty good but it bogged down real bad and i had to keep flipping pages to find something interesting---this was supposed to be about a tsunami coastal event, right?  but, it wasnt, not really.  i felt tricked.  its just a soap opera.",0
"Talk about a collection - when i saw the size of this beast i wondered if I had seen a glitch, if my eyes were giving out after all the horror I had read, or if Kindle was giving me yet another taste of the good life. I had already collected Dracula and a few others for next to nothing, and this seemed like I was doing the same. So i clicked, checked, and was a happy camper.While you have a lot of small things here, the 67 alone is enough to send a reader into some mind-altered vortex that says, ""Danger, Will Robinson."" That danger was not danger at all, however, but was something that was good to the last drippy drop. you really can't beat the size of the beast you get here and, honestly, you can't keep from admiring just how lovely this thing is. It is horror at its finest and it is beautiful in the way you find it coming up and devouring your Kindle.Maybe that's what was meant by waking the sleeping Cthulhu. He's a Kindle man and he's been waiting for someone to download this sea of sexy stories and find him there, waiting.All joking aside, though, get this!",1
"The blurb for this series says...""The `Zombie Chronicles' universe, where the zombies don't stay mindless, shambling adversaries. Instead they grow smarter, faster and stronger as they feed on the flesh of the living.""...and to that statement I would add, ""And where zombie-fighting humans begin to suspect that they, too, are changing as they struggle to survive in this bleak world.""Author Mark Clodi distinguished The Zombie Chronicles by coming up with the very novel idea that Romero-type zombies could learn and grow as they feed.  The human survivors in the Zombie Chronicles world therefore have to content with both types of zombies as they try to survive.The first three Zombie Chronicles books center upon Max, his best friend Bill, a cop Jane Steward, and a great supporting cast of minor characters -- both human and zombie.  Interesting questions are raised:  Can a thinking zombie still care about humanity?  Could zombie and human work together to overcome the common evil?  What qualifies as humanity?  There are some grammatical mistakes in the series, particularly in the first book, but for me those faded in significance as I was caught up in the unique ""smart zombies"" premise, the multidimensional characters (it was particularly interesting to see the world through the eyes of the smart zombies), and the action as Max and friends try to stay alive.In book one, Outbreak, Max meets his first zombie at the office, and fights his way home to his family.",1
"This book does not try to take itself too seriously. The author does not bog us down with reams of technobabble, or try to impress us with his knowledge of theoretical physics.It is a good story, filled with well developed and interesting characters. Most importantly, it is funny. As much as I enjoy science fiction, I also enjoy having a good laugh, and I got plenty of both here.Around 80%, there were of number of technical errors with the text, with some paragraphs repeating, and some missing entirely. It could be I got a bad download, or maybe a glitch in my device. Either way, I do not hold that against the author. However, there were a number of grammatical errors which I did find distracting. Still, the book overall was very good, and I will probably read more from this author.",1
It was alright. Nothing to rave about. It wasn't a bad book however it wasn't memorable. I feel the story was rushed and the characters were not well developed.  It had potential but...This is my opinion of the book so hopefully the author can understand that this time. We are all entitled to an opinion whether it's good or bad,0
"Darkest Fire, available so far only as an e-book, is a short story that is a prequel to the Lords of the Underworld series but it is completely standalone, no Dark possessed Lords here.  Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.  One caution though to readers, if you find a love between beings of two physically different species uncomfortable, this may not be the story for you.",1
This book was very slow in getting to the story. The storyline jumped from scene to scene. The main character was weak and in denial the entire time about her powers. Most of the story she was placing her friends in danger because she was too stupid to do what had to be done to save everyone. Every scene someone had to rescue her from herself and others.,0
"This story was just honestly silly to me.I went into this story with such huge and high hopes. I mean it is not really that often you get a really great Dragon shifter story, an erotica one at that. Well, this was yet again not one of those good ones. In the vain attempt to not make this ranty, because I honestly have no reason to rant, I got it for free so it would just perpetuate the cycle of silly to rant about this short story. Which, to be honest, I have read so many great ones recently I was bound to come across one I didn't really like that much. So in that respect I'm going to say what I liked and what I didn't like and be as respectful as I can to the author.What I liked-I like Rajah. He was a great Alpha male and he really fit into the environment and the world that was created. It was supposed to be other worldly with an old world flare. With the way he talked and his attitude he fit. The concept was honestly a great idea. If you were to run with the general idea and mould it in the proper fashion it had amazing potential. The whole idea that there are Dragon shifters and they will snatch up you're pretty virgin butt if they sniff you out is just hot. The sex was honestly rowdy and downright dirty, she didn't hold back and I liked that. The words were raunchy and I was like ""MEOW!"" I wanted to blow my own flames.What I didn't like-With that being said we get down to the basics of why this short fell short. First off, the story is named after the female lead and she was migraine inducing. Larkspur is a `dolphin' shifter and a virgin, though you could have fooled me. The girl acted offended by being pawed at for a total of 3.5 seconds before she was naked spreading her legs. Yes, I get it's a short and you have a word count you are required to work with, but did she have to talk like a girl from the Valley in Southern California? Honestly, it didn't work for me. The moment Larkspur saw his `manhood' she changed. Her dialogue became unbelievable for the old world setting and she just said the daftest things. She ruined the story for me to be honest. When you use the term ""Well you do have a yummy looking c*ck."" And then have her spread her legs out, a supposed virgin that also doesn't feel any pain when said dragon man slides into her HARD mind you HARD! Make it just a little bit believable please!!!!!Needless to say I don't think I will be running out to get her other books based on this world, though I am curious if she runs the same theme with the women that are just so horribly unappealing.  I feel that this is a rant, I'm sorry that this is a rant but I was in bed reading this at 12am just going `Really! I stayed up for this!' I think I was just far too excited about it.",0
"The Grimm brothers have nothing on Shiloh Walker, who tells a mean tale. Literally. This grim twist on Grimm is original, unique, and interesting, and Walker has penned another dark, rich novella to start an exciting new series. So much urban fantasy and paranormal romance is based around the idea that there's always a kernel of truth in all folk lore and fairy tales, and Walker not only embraces that ideology, she slams into it, tackles it to the ground, and hog ties it until it does her bidding!In Candy Houses, Greta and Rip are known to children everywhere as Gretel of Hansel and Gretel fame, and Rip as in Van Winkle, but neither one of the fairy tales and folk lore that surround them do more than glimmer at the truth. Greta, as she prefers to be called now, and Rip, didn't get anything resembling a happily ever after like the stories say. They got an immortal upgrade and were given wings, becoming a member of the Grimm, a group of guardian angels that are here to help humanity and save them from the myriad of dangers from other realms, demons, and other assorted nasties. Their wings are more metaphorical than actual, of course, but their skill is unmatched, and they're very hard to kill. They have to be. It's a dark, often lonely, deadly life that takes its toll on its warriors.Greta and Rip worked together about a hundred years ago and after a night of passion that rocked both their worlds, Greta fled, and hasn't been able to stop thinking of Rip ever since. And Rip knows that he may not survive another encounter with Greta, the woman he loved and lost after far too brief a time all those years ago. Could the fact that they've ended up in the same city at the same time, fighting what turns out to be the same fight be a good omen for them both? Perhaps Happily Ever After isn't out of the question after all?Candy Houses manages to develop both Greta's and Rip's characters with a surprising level of depth and complexity as well as provide a truly taut and tense plot that moves quickly even as it offers a lot of world building and mythos creation to start this series. I'm impressed again at Walker's ability to use what length allowed in her novellas to provide such a full reading experience, and I think the twist on the fairy tale idea is brilliant.The only caveat (IMO) was the final conflict at the end. With all the development and mythos explanation, Candy Houses is still limited to a novella length story, and there seems to have been a sacrifice made. There were motivations and explanations that didn't get explained, and the conflict with Big Bad ended up being a lot of hype with little hazard. It was a little of a letdown. Still, points for everything Walker manages to accomplish in this nifty little novella and I've already downloadedNo Prince Charming: Grimm's Circle, Book 2so I can continue with these dark and delicious fairy tales.",1
"The general story is cute, the idea of a hotel maid finding love with not one, but two hot men. The steam fizzled about halfway through, which was annoying because it was pretty steamy at first. My greatest complaint is that the author either needs an editor or she really should get her money back from whoever edited it. There were grammatical errors, word choice issues, spelling problems... it was just distracting. It's a promising beginning to this author's career, but I would just prefer that she take the time for some good editing.",0
I enjoyed reading this book. It kept me interested from start to finish. It was hard to put down. Definitely worth purchasing this good short read.,1
I liked the story very own home but I did not like the way the book skipped a year...or example one page she had no cell phone a chapter later she had one. All in all a solid book and would not hesitate to read another by this author.,1
Not really what the title says.. He doesn't go out and just shoot people..  Well thought out and worth reading...,1
"This is yet another story full of humanly flawed characters from Diana Bold. She doesn't shy away from hurtful emotions in her stories, which I absolutely love about her books. She makes you believe that these people could exist in the real world--in fact I believe I know a few of them.As the daughter of a duke, Natalia knows that she must someday do her duty and marry where her father commands. However, this has not stopped her from dreaming about a war hero who seems to be nothing like the men of society--who only see her large dowry when they look at her. She has built up the reputation as a cold lady who follows her own strict rule of not allowing two dances to the same gentleman at a ball. In reality, she doesn't wish to encourage any man who she knows will not meet with her father's approval. Dylan is the unloved, unwanted second son of an earl. Having sold his commission, he is down on funds and sees no harm in participating in a silly wager--get a cold fish of a girl to dance with him twice. Only the girl is warm and kind and seems to see through him like no one else ever cared to. He never counted on losing his heart but he may have just wagered more than he bargained to lose.I could totally relate to Natalia--who feared being wanted for something other than herself. She had flaws just like any girl. She was insecure, had a heartfelt desire to be wanted, a hard time forgiving and was perhaps a little immature in her daydreams. But all of that is real. The same could be said with all of Diana's heros'. I just started reading her books recently. I've found again and again that she writes all of them with the same passion and dedication. To be as true to life as possible. No cookie cutter, perfect do-no-wrong hero for her! He must be a Man. With a Man's flaws and insecurities. Which is why you are sure to see me searching for the next Diana Bold book I can get my hands on. I can't get enough of her stories.",1
This book is trash and not even realistic.  No way three brothers are going to share one woman.  Not in a million years.  A bunch of smut.,0
"Although the premise of Serial sounded very interesting to me, I was disappointed in the story.  It was extremely violent and gruesome.  This is not for you if you have a weak stomach.  I had anticipated a psychological thriller and instead read pages recounting violent and gory deaths.  I wish it had scared me more than grossed me out.",0
"Not one of the &#34;Witness&#34; series about Josie Baylor Bates, despite it's title, nonetheless is just as good a read.  Character Witness has some colourful characters in it which add to the fun and games and make it a lively page turner.  Very much enjoyed it.",1
I loved this story. The sex was HOT. This trio made a lovely m&eacute;nage. I look forward to more. It would be great to have the entire series in one collection.,1
Author made a serious error by referring to these notable women by their first names in the major portion of the book. I finally made a list of their full names to keep track. It was distracting. Be forewarned. Lot of research went into this book. The editor should have helped the author.,0
"Wow.. this was HOT HOT HOT and did I say HOT?? I have been reading Romance books since I was 15 years old and I blushed at the first couple, but haven't since until I read Double Exposure!!! This is another one of those that you cannot put down. Thank you Tori, for another great one!! Ok.. starting on the next one.. Blame it on Texas!!",1
"No Comfort was a heartbreaking story about the life of Llewellyn Trout presented in a journal/blog format. I had a hard time accepting the format Pietsch chose for this book. Very little structure, if any, resulted in grammar mayhem. In the beginning, I was less bothered by this decision; since No Comfort was told in first person, Lew was young and it was written in the tongue a young boy would use. As the story progressed, and Lew aged, I was hoping the language would too. I found my frustration continually growing.I am still perplexed of the validity of this story. The Foreward presents No Comfort as a true account of the life of Llewellyn Trout; it even references encouragement and affirmation by a Dr. Kent, Doctor of Psychiatry.  Yet, a list at the end of the book for other fictional stories of abuse implies No Comfort is a work of fiction. I realize abuse is relevant and needs awareness, but I am not sure this story is going to do that.At the halfway point, I have decided to shelve this book. Not because of the disturbing nature of its content, but rather because I have read other accounts of abuse providing a better explanation of the seriousness of issue.",0

If you like your books to make sense, then it's not.There is definately one scene that will make you turn 10 shades of red.",0

"Young love true to its form... especially for a young feline girl that fell in love with a wolf. The wolf pure blood and he felt the same way, until his got sick. Then so much changed... a young girl left heartbroken and wolf left howling in dispair.A few years later they are both a bit older and wiser, and for Gionne comes a chance to have his little feline. For Jenna... did she still love Gionne, has he changed? she doesnt care not one wit if he has a mate.. right?? well if he thinks to boss her around he has another think coming, she literly purrs at that thought.Ive had this book a while in my stash... and very glad I ran across it, I loved it. The story just flowed and loved the characters especially Razi, Gionne's half sister (I bet she will have her own story) a bit of mystery a dab of danger, and some scenes that set the sheets a fire. Have fun I did enjoy!",1
"Rather dull. And this box story, what an idiotic idea. I never become interested to the heroine, and I won't purchase another book in this serie. I",0
"First, I would love to know what ""actual events"" this is based on.  Second, short is an understatement.  I am tired of the lack of build up or development because the ""scary feelings"" take care of it.  They don't, the author has so much potential, but frankly the story is to short to really tell.  I am left unsure if this was just a synopsis of another story or if the author has real potential.  I would be willing to read another, but I hate to be disappointed again.",0
"Having grown up on a diet of Sherlock Holmes, I was keen to see how this compared. My recollection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, it being some time since I read them,  is that they are difficult to beat. The language in this book is a little archaic but with the help of the Kindle dictionary this wasn't too much of a problem. Not sure I would have said the same if the dictionary had not been available. I enjoyed this enough to buy volume 2.",1
"According to Twain, Heaven is years from earth, even when you are transported at .1 speed of light. It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow. 'Now, this was published 1907, and an early manuscript exists from 1868!",1
"If I were to pick an analogy...it's about as intriguing as a cup of cold forgotten tea. If you are thristy, you'll drink it. But only because it's there and you're too lazy to get up and get something else.It was over very quickly and not a whole lot of background was given. Not a lot of world building or development of characters done. It's pretty much a quickly read and quickly forgotten story. The cover isn't very inspiring either.",0
"I couldn't get myself in a place where I could wrap my head around this book.  It just didn't make alot of sense to me.  I could search the historical content and probably get it but, I guess I am just too lazy.  I would rather read something I get.",0
"Although this was a decent page-turner, I'm still trying to figure if it wasn't just to get to the end. Decent plot, albeit fairly predictable. I will admit, though, for a free read, it was a good way to kill a couple of hours.",0

"I met Dan and Elle in Dirty, Megan Hart's first Harlequin Spice release. I loved that book.I won't rehash the storyline because the blurb does that amazingly well. What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real. Megan Hart has quickly become on of my favorite authors.",1
"There's certain (sub-)genres I go into with high expectations. I have questions and I want answers. I want a specific thing told to me about what the genre is, it has to be believable, I want to be convinced on certain things but above that I want to be made to understand and believe them. Unfortunately, m&eacute;nages are at the top of that list. I need the story sold to me, to have it believable but it has to suck me in right from the beginning or there's no hope of redemption. That's a bit harsh, I know, and I'm sorry, but it's the way I feel with m&eacute;nages.With that said, this book frustrated me beyond belief. It didn't start off on a good note for me. The first 50% of the book is essentially just smut and for someone like me who prefers at least double the plot than smut, it was unbearable to get through. I was extremely close to calling this my first DNF but I agreed to stick it out until the half-way mark... Thankfully, the book finally caught my eye around that time (although it could have also been from the fact I cheated and skipped to certain parts of the book to see if I was actually wasting my time or not).Now, just to clarify, I'd say this book is made up of about 60-70% smut. Which I hated and resulted in me skipping those scenes. They were redundant, boring and unnecessary. Only a select few actually contributed to the story. The rest of it seemed like a page filler to me.It was hard for me to connect with the three MCs. For one, Luke, which is the only pov we get (in first person) is never actually described. So, I have no idea what he looks like and if he was described then I completely missed that because I don't remember any description about him regarding his appearances besides a reference to his father. Richard and Matthew, the other MCs, are perfectly described. But the thing is none of them know anything about each other. Like nothing. At ALL. They jumped into bed together at a club. Three times. Agree to go on a date. Still know nothing about each other. Then move in together. Still not knowing anything about each other. I didn't like it. Especially with the fact Luke didn't want to put Matthew or Richard into a situation of possibly getting hurt by his father but he still moved in with them when he knew his father would eventually find him and seek to make their lives a living hell. Yeah.....Anyway, so, yeah. I was frustrated throughout most of the book. To me, the relationship wasn't believable. I still don't understand their relationship. Yeah, at the end, you can tell they loved each other but it was made impossible for me to love them because there was no dialogue between them getting to know each other. What we know of them is what Luke gave us in brief summaries of what he learned from their 'dates'. Well, I wanted to actually experience those dates. Instead, I got the smexing after the date.Needless to say, I didn't much like this book. I couldn't connect with the characters or their relationship, the smexing put me off so much from the start there was barely a chance of redemption for this story. With that said, I did appreciate Sloan Parker's writing. It drew me in when the smut didn't overpower the pages. That's what captured my attention and made me want to keep reading when all I wanted to do was complain about the book. I was ready to give up on it but then the smexing lessened slightly and her words drew me in. The conflict revolving around Luke's father was a bit cliched and unbelievable but it still made me stick with the story.Overall, I'm sorry, I can't recommend this book. I never connected with the characters. I still feel as if they don't really know each other and none of it was believable to me.",0
"I think this was kind of a waste of $4. I didn't really see anything in here that wasn't covered by the manual, a lot of it was super simplistic. I guess if you're you not tech savvy this could be useful, but I figured most of the stuff out without reading the user's manual, much less this overly simplistic book.I'd get it if you are struggling using your Kindle, but don't expect anything beyond a how-to.",1

"Willow Gregory, also known as the former Miss Firecracker, has spent the past year making sure her behavior was all above board.  Her decision to cut loose and celebrate her freedom from the crown and sash has landed her in big trouble.  The simple fact that she wakes up in a stranger's bed wearing nothing but her Miss Firecracker sash with no memory of how she got there is just the beginning of what promises to be a wild week.Wyoming sheepherder Blake West has been at loose ends since his father decided to retire and sell the ranch.  He jumped at the chance to manage his friend's bar in Nebraska while trying to decide what he wants to do with his life.  Blake is a genuinely nice guy but he's also got a domineering side and for Willow, the combination is intoxicating.Willow has always been more of a tomboy than a beauty queen but when a childhood nemesis entered her name into the contest she had too much pride to back out.  In a way she'd kind of hoped she'd learn to be more `feminine' but let's face it, `ladies' don't get drunk and bust up a bar.  The only thing that kept her from a jail cell is a condition she agreed to - to work at the bar until she's earned enough to pay for the damage she caused.Willow's definitely not happy with this situation, but there's no denying she's incredibly attracted to Blake.  When she thanks him for being such a nice guy and not taking advantage of her inebriated state the night before, Blake sets her straight and defuses any notion she has that he's not interested in her sexually.  Blake's only filling in for his friend at the bar for about a week so keeping any relationship they embark on a no-strings attached basis would only make sense, but the more time they spend together the more they realize that what they share is much more than just sex.Lorelei James' WILD WEST BOYS series has a new addition that is hotter than any 4th of July show.  MISS FIRECRACKER had me chuckling at Willow's drunken antics - and I could only imagine how her clothing ended up hanging from the ceiling fan.  Willow and Blake fit together so perfectly that they're a pleasure to read about - especially when you consider their encounters are hot enough to leave you sweating.  Ms. James is a talented author who never fails to thrill readers with her sexy heroes and delightful storylines.If you haven't read MISTRESS CHRISTMAS yet, don't worry, these stories definitely don't need to be read in order.  The heroes of both stories are brothers and much of the plots take place in bars but they're different enough that they're well worth reading.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"I wrote an earlier review but was  not allowed to send it, because I went into detail as to why I did not like the book and used examples from the book as to why.  Naturally this book is described as Erotic Romance and those examples were not appropriate.First off, this book is not romantic and it certainly was not steamy.  I saw no romance in this book until the very last few pages.  Other than that, the hero was strictly Master and seemed to take pleasure in the punishment.  He was not protective of her in that he made her ""get into position"", and a position that was very revealing for all to see her finer qualities who might be visiting and were allowed to touch wherever they wished while he watched.  It reminded me of the Story of O.  The entire book was focused on one aspect of her anatomy, and I hint at it in the title of this Review. There was no pleasure to pull you into the book to feel what she felt and to go ""OMG"" at steamy scenes such as books from Vivien Sparx.I have read much better Master/Submissive books wherein the Master was kind and considerate and eventually one could see something growing between the two such as love.  These Masters did not like the idea of someone else looking at her finer qualities let alone touch.  When I see the word ""romance"", I expect to see exactly that and/or something growing between the hero and heroine as the two work together in that sort of relationship. I did not see this in this book.I forced myself to read to the end hoping that it would get better.  It only got worse and to me, degrading.  I do not care if I never read another one of Ms. Cartwright's books. Very disappointed.",0
"This is the first Allan Quartermain book I've read, and it certainly won't be the last.  In fact, I just started reading King Solomon's Mines.The Kindle formatting was OK for this.  The one gripe I had is that there were various end notes that were really at the end of the book.  Because it's kind of hard to turn real pages and then flip back, it would have been nice if the notes had been at the ends of chapters.However, since this version was free, I'm not going to dock it a star.  There weren't that many notes anyway, and they weren't that vital to the story.This is the story of Allan Quartermain's last adventure.  He, Sir Henry Curtis, and Commander John Good go in search of a lost city of white people in Africa.  There is also Umslopagaas, a Zulu ex-chief/warrior, who might be my favorite character.  I hope he shows up in another Allan Quartermain novel.  (Curtis & Good are also in King Solomon's Mines, and so far, Umslopagaas has been mentioned, but I don't know if he'll actually show up.)The book is a lot of fun.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure story.",1
"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series. I enjoyed this exciting tale and will be looking out for more of her work.",1
I recieved this ebook complimentry and it just blew my mind. The characters will just blow you away. Eric AKA Rauel really makes you think what would you do in his position and would you be able to do the things he did mostly from watching tv or finding out details on the internet. It feels like you are right there with him from the beginning until the end biting your fingernails the whole way. I cant wait to read more from this author. Sit down and take a deep breath and enjoy the ride.,1
"Volume 1 of the Sherlock Holmes series is absolutely great for introducing the great detective Sherlock Homes and his companion, Dr. Watson, who has accompanied Holmes in many of his adventures. Volume 2 includes all different types of mysteries, like murder, crime, blackmail, and other bloodthirsty mysteries. It's thrilling to read, and I recommend it to anyone who loves mysteries. These books will definitely make you want to buy them all. Well worth the time.",1
this was my first book from this author and I quite enjoyed it.  The sexual tension between the 2 characters and his friend was hot.  The sex was hot.  You just fall in love with the characters from the start.  It was a short story but it was a great one.,1
This book was just one more great example of Delle Jacobs Scottish tales.  I love her writing.  It takes you into the story and makes you part of it!,1
"Although it had an interesting storyline, I couldn't really get into it. It took me over a month to read, when usually a book this size would be finished in less than a week.",0
another good story.  ms Feehan continues to write books I enjoy.  I have read too many to count.  I recommend this story to any one who likes paranormal reading.,1
"Most of the reviewers found the writing and storyline 'riveting'. I found the writing and storyline average; nothing to really complain about but nothing especially interesting in the writing style. The plot line was predictable. The main characters had some depth but many of the supporting characters were homogenous. The choice of setting seemed more for the titillation factor than for the historical relevance.The focus was on the main character's sexual frustrations and strained relationship with his father. I mainly kept reading to find out how long the kid would put up with his father's abuse. Billing this as historical, though, is a disservice to readers who expect history interwoven in the story. Historical details were few and far between, which was disappointing given the extensive research that the author did for this book.",0

"Different little sci fi romance/erotica novella. It is told totally from the POV of the alien who buys a human as a pet. Has some age play elements so it might not be for all readers. I found the writing fairly well done. The physical sci fi elements were not strong as no effort was made to make things alien except for the the fact that they were 8 foot tall and kept humans as pets. For example, they drank coffee, no effort made to make it an alien drink. This sort of thing was consistent throughout.I enjoyed reading from the alien's view point. I felt his emotions and actions were pretty believable.",1
This book was very refreshing because it gave an honest portrayal of how families survived in our early western days. I liked the fact that the wife and mother-in-law teamed up to save the day. The growing romance and respect of these two people forced together by circumstance is worth the read.,1
"I've read many books from Stormy Glenn. While hardly literary masterpieces, I hold them to an admittedly lower standard than I do other novels. They're fun and sexy and are very light, but entertaining, reads. While I normally rate her books between three and four stars, I gave this one a five star review because it did evoke some heartfelt emotions.Ryce and Saul are mated werewolves. They're deeply in love with each other. The only blemish on their relationship is that Saul heads into town every Friday night to seemingly ""sow his oats"". This slowly eats away at Ryce, and their relationship is gradually going down the tubes, even though Ryce is still hopelessly in love with Saul.When Ryce's frustration reaches epic proportions, he decides to head into town too to see if he can have some fun. There, he runs into Cary and recognizes Cary as his mate. Cary is a tri-omega, a werewolf assigned two mates to help keep them grounded. Once claimed by one mate though, a tri-omega must be claimed by the other in the near future, or die. Even after claimed by both, they must be continually claimed every few days or they whither away. Ryce knows a bit about tri-omegas. He knows that fate doesn't assign a tri-omega two mates without those two mates being assigned to each other. Since he and Saul are mates, Saul must also be Cary's mate, so Ryce goes and claims Cary. When Saul comes home though and finds Cary and Ryce asleep together, he's heartbroken and feels betrayed, even though he knows he's been putting Ryce through the same thing. Cary leaves Ryce asleep in the bed and comes downstairs to meet Saul, but the drunken heartbroken Saul is so jealous and angry, he sends Cary away.The is one of the better stories of the series. There's a lot of emotional angst. We have Cary feeling the elation of discovering his two mates and finally being mated, only to be thrown out by Saul and knowing that he'll die soon without them. We have Ryce who cannot abide by Saul's cheating excursions into town anymore, but still is madly in love with him. We have Saul feeling great self-shame over what he does every week and the fact that it hurts Ryce so much. And then we have the growing realization that whatever it is that Saul does every week, it's not cheating, it's forced upon him, and he must keep his mouth shut and let everyone think he's a scumbag for their own protection.There's some nicely heartfelt scenes in the story that surprise. Such as an argument between Saul and Ryce that turns into lovemaking, but during the lovemaking, it becomes apparent to Ryce that this is Saul's goodbye. Another piece of dialog that tugs the heart is a conversation with Micah, another tri-omega that can sense emotions. While everyone is sure Saul is cheating, Micah informs them that whatever Saul is doing, he's not cheating. Micah can feel Saul's love for Ryce, and it almost fully consumes every other emotion and is the driving force behind Saul. These touches at heartfelt romance to the story, elevating it above just normal erotica.It's a pretty complex tale that is sexy, romantic, exciting, and intriguing. It's one of Ms. Glenn's better stories in the series. I normally wouldn't give a five-star review to light tales like this, but since it does rise above the others, I passed on an extra star to it.",1
This book was confusing in the beginning and again not to my thinking thought out. I enjoyed the book but again ends to soon,1
great read and knowledgeable about these tribes of Michigan.  Would highly recommend to anyone to read for any reason for school or just to get informed.,1
"This is a bad, bad, awful book.  It reads as if it was written by an excited twelve-year-old.  Every other line with an exclaimation point -- I'm sorry, I didn't even know people did that for real.  It contained so many unnecessary words (things like:  ""Under the window, where he looked presently, he saw something that hadn't been there when he last looked a moment ago"") and just unfortunate phrasings.  The plot is stupid and the characters are so unrealistic it is almost impossible to believe that the author regularly consumes any type of decent fiction.  Even recreational exposure to mediocre storytelling would make this level of badness impossible.  Finally, I'm a reader who regularly reads challenging books and I'm still unclear on several aspects of the story, even after rereading them a few times.Lines like ""Suddenly, he was inside of her!"" to describe a date rape -- I'm not even making this up.  The exclaimation point is really used there.  I don't know if the author thinks this is a fresh and effective way to write or if he just doesn't care.This is a bad, bad, bad book.",0
Unfortunately was not a big fan of this one. I just don't understand staying in a marriage with someone you don't love knowing that they manipulated you into it. Plus the resolution was too quick with her forgiving him too soon. Just no.,0
"I feel that this author used a thesaurus simply because another reviewer suggested it.  Not all uses of a thesaurus are needed.. the misuse of the word concertino I think was just to much.  The book is poorly edited and just reading what one wrote could have fixed many of the problems.Next I'd like to add that I don't care how much of a hymen a women has left by the time she is in her twenties hell even as a teenager you CAN NOT tell if she is a virgin by a ""popping"" or how hard it was to press pass something.  Inexperience in the woman's body and in sex really gets to me.  If you are not grown up enough to know about this subject don't write about it.  Hell as a freshman in high school we were taught in our health class exactly how a woman's hymen works..  If one is female they should know this, if one is male and not old enough to know this they shouldn't be writing sex scenes.Next the in such a short book the sex scene should not span 12% of the book, for one scene.  Either write supernatural fantasy fiction, or write smut.. not very many authors can do this..  This is just another case of how in a short story people fall desperately in love with each other at first sight.. and the name.. really.. people should stay away from the name Isabella or Bella in werewolf or vampire books right now.. gives people a bad taste of the Twilight books, which were NOT good books.",0
"One thing that I have learned about Jodi Redford is to always expect the unexpected. You never quite know what she is going to come up with. The only thing that you can be sure of is that whatever surprises she has in store, they will be entertaining. Lover Enslaved was definitely no exception.It should be no surprise that the characters are what made this book so much fun. They were witty, fun, just the right amount of snarky and the supporting characters were just as much fun as Dash and Mara. Of course there were some serious moments too. Both of these characters had been through a lot and they both had their own share of secrets. During the course of this story they both discovered as much about themselves as they did about each other.The bad guys were despicable, the humor was as smart as it was funny, the characters had depth and there was just enough action to keep everyone happy. I also have to mention that I can't remember the last time I read a book by Jodi Redford that had quite this much *ahem* tension. By the end of the book I actually felt sorry for Dash. There's only so much torture a sex crazed Fae should have to endure.As usual, pay attention to the warning... it's for real and not an exaggeration. This author knows how to pull out all the stops and keep things interesting until the very last page.The next book in this series, Lover Enraptured, is sure to be just as much fun as this one. Can't wait until August 2013!",1
"Derrick is a Circ.  He is big, bad, and lusty.  He is on the hunt for Sabrina Torrence, the woman who helped Kelly, a Circ mate escape Pearson labs.  He and his fellow Circs want to know why she did what she did and if she is a spy, they want to know that too.  What they don't realize is that the woman they are looking for isn't a human; she is a Circ as well and she is about to experience her first change.Book 3 of Marie Harte's Circe's Recruits, Derrick is a bit of a disappointment.  First, I found it hard to believe that Sabrina and Derrick cared for each other.  I couldn't sense any feelings other than hormones between them.  Derrick's feelings for Sabrina stabilized the farther in the book I read and that helped some.  Sabrina's feelings were off; she kept constantly trying to leave knowing full well she would be brought back again.  My second disappointment with Derrick had to do with the storyline revolving around Sabrina accepting Roane as her alpha.  I read the first installment. I KNEW Roane was mated so what Sabrina had to do to show submission to him angered me greatly. I almost didn't finish reading Derrick because of it.  That single scene ruined the entire book and I know I will not read this novel again.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
"I like the way the books started, with a strong story base line and what seemed to be strong definable characers, but after 15% of the book it all went down hill from there...if the author would have stuck to a little bit of mystery and crime solving and lot less sex it would have turn out to be a better book, as it was...porn pretty much sums it up and for me that is disappointing.",0
"The combination of an artist heroine and male romance writer hero sounded like an interesting combination.  Unfortunately, there was precious little about the characters' occupations and their influence on their lives.  Rather, we are treated to a lot of extraneous detail ""frosting"" about the characters' clothes, the city they live in, the food they eat, and their living quarters, the setting for a series of sex scenes which are amazingly predictable.  The characters are contemporary romance archetypes, and their problems are happily solved in the last fifteen pages through fantastic sex.  If only life were like this.I didn't pay anything for this book, and I deleted it from my library.",0
"This piece is well written in a dark, perverse, way.  I just am puzzled about what the message is here. To depict children as mean spirited monsters is to negate the innocence of childhood.  I did not like this at all!!!",0
"I enjoyed this book because the demon world is real.  It kept my attention from the beginning to the end. I surely enjoy any reading material that shows that GOD is real.  What I did not like about this book, it ended to soon.  Good read for a person who is knowledgeable about demon spirits and angelic being or a person with an open mind about Jesus as Lord.",1
"I enjoyed it. It was a superficial read which means there wasn't a ton of explanation of different things - like the town, why the alpha could stay an alpha even when he was not there, how easy it is to turn into a puma (why aren't there more of them then?), the heroine being fine with becoming a werepuma, the rushed mating process, etc.What sets this book apart is its humor. I found myself chuckling very frequently at some really LOL moments. I must have a strange sense of humor because most books others consider funny don't even get me to crack a smile. Whatever. This series does.As for the plot and the characters - they are o.k.Bottom line: Sex was hot, dialogue was funny, characters were likable enough. I bought the rest of the series. At a less than three buck price tag they are more than worth it.",1
"I received a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of review. The review is my honest opinion and I was not paid for this service.I liked the author's idea of creating a Comic Book of the Bible to get children and young adults interested in reading God's word. He chose some excellent portions of the Bible to portray, but did not tell enough of the stories to get the message across. While this book has wonderful illustrations to gain the reader's attention, I felt as though there were not enough illustrations to be deemed as a Comic Book or Graphic Novel. Unfortunately there were several misspelled words throughout the book which is a distraction. This book would do better with more illustration panels and more of a storyline. I felt that the author did not capture and keep the reader's attention.",0
"Kind of cutesy spanking story.  This book is a bit dated since it is copyrighted in 2001 and the war mentioned looks like it was probably the Serb/Bosnian conflict.  Seems like ancient history today.  But a sexy, hot-bodied ex-military boy is always hot.  Descriptions of her &#34;custard&#34; bottom and character's use of &#34;sugar man&#34; when she's supposedly from San Francisco seem strange.  Also a scene where the hero is chasing the heroine with a belt and appears to be about ready to whack her in the face with it before they're interrupted, not even remotely sexy.  This is one of those just too cutely written stories for my taste.  Not awful but not really good and certainly nothing worth re-reading.",0
"This book had particular interest for me because I am currently living in Cambodia and am all too familiar with the landmine problem here. The author had clearly done his/her homework as the story was chock full of information on mines, how they are used and how they are disposed of. The characters were also well developed and the plot moved along quickly with enough unexpected turns to keep me interested.I know that the theme of the 'wounded warrior' who has to fight their own personal demons to solve a crisis is popular almost to the point of cliche' and I found it a bit overworked here with the protagonist's addiction to opiates. Consider this 'House' in military gear trying to stop a raging terrorist rather than an infectious disease. Aside from that, and the somewhat implausible ending, it was a good read worthy of a few hours of your time.",1
"Not much to it, I must say. I didn't expect much to happen in such a short story, but the writing is not strong either. There was no flavour, no spark in the sex scenes, just a bland description that left me wondering when the hot parts were going to come, if at all.",0
Interesting story. Kinda crazy but believable since it was in Vegas. Like the Jim storylines. Looking forward to next book.,1
I just could not finish this book. In fact I read about 10% of the book abd got so creeped out that I had to stop. Perhaps the out of body experience would have been interesting but when I started to read about the murderers I just got the chills and had to stop reading. This was just awful!,0
"This is a short erotic story about a football coach & music teaching hooking up. The entire story is him asking her out, her saying yes, she goes to his house, they have sex while talking in football terms the entire time. Then their in love. The end.

"Briony Swift is a college math professor.  Her life is ordered and calculated and well, boring.  She flies the straight and narrow and can't remember the last time she did anything fun or risqu&eacute;.  Not the type of person to draw attention to herself, Briony knows that the hidden attraction she feels for two of her students is totally wrong and refuses to explore her feelings.  When the two men in question, Nic Potter and Leo Phelps, come to her office to get her to sign a form, all bets are off because once her name is on their drop/add slips, these two men are no longer her students.  And that scares Briony most of all.Two Plus One is a risqu&eacute; and rambunctious romp of erotic goodness.  Leo and Nic are naughty but nice and they are exactly what Briony needed in her life.

The story was a bit dry at times but it was a book that was hard to put down, also.",1
"The Guardians was certainly not bad. It was well worth its price, and made for a great read.The characters were pretty well developed, each with a distinctive personality, except for Duke Angaria, who just came across as hateful. The guardians were all well developed. You either liked them (Atock and Enton) or didn't like them (Phillip). Whether you liked them or not, they all added to the book. Cassandra also made for a nice addition to the cast, though she played a minor role. The characters have a lot of growing to do, but in a several book series, that should be accomplished easily.Kelcer doesn't make much sense in this book, though I hope in the next book, he will be described more.The religious satire in this book is a nice touch with historical parts like the Inquisition, and Censorship. Though they have yet to be built upon, with at least four books they probably will be.The Plot is pretty good, with an interesting first half. Some of the time at Mul-Dune is boring, but towards the end it picks up and finishes with a bang. The death of Callin and Murleen was a nice touch, we got to meet them and feel for them.All in all it's a pretty good book. It doesn't excel, with a lot to be built upon, but makes for an interesting read.",1
"Cliff Black's stories about the southwest Four Corner area are mesmerizing and toughly realistic. This area, filled with mysteries about the Ancient People is abundantly rich, with day to day real life struggles liberally sprinkled in.A myriad of thoughts torment the character's minds and the author cleverly burns nagging details into their psyches, details that refuse to leave.This is a beguiling mystery that turns a bit wild, stressing the protagonist, Daniel Corbin, just enough to gloss over his underlying paranoia.The reader can easily get enmeshed in local history, or enjoy being introduced to varied native tribal information.Black always presents well plotted tales that move at a good pace. And, Daniel Corbin proves to be a believable investigator.Many years ago, I too was attracted to test haunting mystic of The Ancient Ones, the Pueblo Indians and The Cliff Dwellers. This novel renewed that curiosity.The Trickster stories and the Coyote legends stir imaginations. The Jicarilla Apache background ties a connection cord between the reader and this area. The Four Corners weaves a magical spell to wind around, and strengthen, wavering minds which must confront deeply rooted fears. Maybe, just maybe, the family really was cursedThis novel is filled with deaths, corruption and devious plots. Excellent.",1

"Unable to believe the number of business trips his brother-in-law Keith O'Connell makes to Dundee, Idaho, Isaac Russell decides to serendipitously follow him.  Isaac is stunned to find that Keith has another wife with three young daughters besides his sibling Liz.Forced to make a decision, Keith chooses his Idaho family for the sake of his offspring.  When his despondent sister Liz decides to follow her ""husband"" to Idaho, Isaac does likewise to insure she does not break the law by doing something stupid or even try to do something stupider like getting her ""husband"" to come back to her.  Complicating matters at least in Isaac's mind is his attraction to Keith's schoolteacher first wife Reenie Holbrook, who uses her maiden name.Big girls do cry when they suffer broken hearts as both women do when the truth about Keith's bigamy surfaces.  However, Reenie recovers faster perhaps because she has the kids to take care of (no time for breakdowns) and the interest of Isaac to help her move on while Liz feels abandoned and betrayed first by her two-timing spouse and then her brother.  She and the kids provide the fresh extended look at the impact of bigamy.Harriet Klausner",1

SK #2 is female, hitchhikes, does her thing, and abandons the evidence. What happens when they meet is interesting, to say the least. The author of this little gem has the idea of Chekov's gun down pat - when you see something, it's important.

"Kelly Kendall is a man with issues, a fact that he knows very well and has coped with by having Will as an all-around house boy.  Kelly enjoys his life as a recluse and having Will around makes life better than Kelly expected.  However, Kelly has secrets from the world, and although Will shares them, Kelly is determined to keep them safely hidden.  As the author of the acclaimed Doorways, Kelly has managed to keep his identity hidden from the world, but when he writes a parody of Doorways called Windows on a dare from Will, it attracts all sorts of attention - attention that Kelly doesn't want.Jae-sun Fields is incensed that someone would dare write a parody of the beloved coming-of-age novel Doorways.  Working for the gossip rag The Adversary, Jae sets out to find and expose the awful woman, who is surely the culprit, of such desecration of his favorite novel.  However, as his investigation progresses he finds Kelly MacKay, who seems more than tangentially connected to his quest.  But what will Jae do with the information he finds?As Jae and Kelly continually meet, more than information is found.  Kelly is immensely attracted to Jae, but fears what such a connection might mean to his self-circumscribed isolation.  Jae wants to pursue Kelly for information, but also to satisfy his curiosity about the attraction between them.  Can both of these men make it work?ePistols at Dawn is a great emotional read that delves into the mysteries of the human mind and what it means to be gay in a not so accepting society.  Jae is a wonderfully funny character with his determination to find his nemesis and his ire at the desecration of his favorite book.  Kelly is so full of quirks that it is almost too much to deal with, but Z.A. Maxfield makes him a likeable character when she uses Will as a source of reality and mocking that slowly pushes Kelly to emerge from his shell.  As the story progresses it is sometimes hard to like Jae for his actions, but his ethics win in the end, making him a better man.  Kelly, on the other hand, is crippled by his OCD and fear of being found out as the author of such a revered work that he believes to be the product of such a self flagellation exercise.  Even as the relationship between Kelly and Jae is plagued by pot-holes in the road of love, their coming together in the end finds them both being better men for all their suffering.  As expected Z.A. Maxfield presents characters and situations that will pull you into the story and reading the book all in one sitting.

It's a brief, concise accounting of the surgeon who attended President Lincoln during his final hours before succumbing to the mortal gunshot wound to the head.  I enjoyed how the surgeon set the stage a few moments before President Lincoln was shot, the 9.5 hours that he lived after being shot, and the events that happened up to the point of the funeral.  I felt the the surrealness, panic, excitement, and sadness that Dr. Leale felt.  This of course is a story from the surgeon's point of view.",1

"This book deserves 2.5 stars. It's not the worst thing I've read, yet it wasn't the best either.The protagonist, Emily Fenwick, is a police officer who is suddenly whisked into an alternate New York set in 1890. Except it's not really an alternate New York, nor are there any scenarios that could be labeled steampunk. It's more fantasy-based with a world that I found intriguing.Emily wakes up in Steamside, a world connected to 1890's ""normal"" New York. Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads. POVs were difficult to distinguish, and the dialogue was all jumbled up. The romance was tedious and unbelievable. Have I mentioned juvenile?It was a fun read, but Steamside Chronicles just wasn't the best.",0

"I understand that a time travel romance novel is not going to be Shakespeare but I would appreciate at least some form of logic. I can't begin to tell you how many things bugged me about this story. Besides the atrocious spelling and grammar, the plot and characters were just plain silly. Kat went from being obnoxious (which obviously translated to strength) to being a victim (which somehow translated to softness and a resilient spirit). The dialogue was terrible. Leafy boy? Buster?Seriously does anyone talk like that?There is also the glaring fact that a 21st century woman kept excusing absolutely heinous actions by her new warm and fuzzy slave-trading, child-murdering, woman-raping family because they didn't make her sleep with the other livestock (read: people).As far as I'm concerned, coercing her into having sex before he told her that she wouldn't be allowed to keep her child was just another example of what a great guy Leif was. At every opportunity to believe in her, her ""husband"" failed but in Kat's mind that was all right because, apparently when you've got piercing blue eyes and a six-pack, you can squeeze your wife's face so hard she cries and it's taken as a sign of what a passionate, conflicted, deep man you are. Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the plotline of Kat being erased from existence if her ancestor was killed? Leif was such a strong leader that he quaked in his buckskin boots every time he thought his warriors might think he wasn't tough? And where, oh where, did the ancient Norse get potatoes?? I could go on, but you get the idea.",0
"Let me begin by saying this is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time. I believe this would make a great movie, and I've even got the actor picked out!Other reviewers have described the plot so there is no need for me to go there.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because of the numerous misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and other grammatical problems which were terribly distracting. After finishing the book I looked at the credits and saw this was originally published in 1995.  This obviously means the Kindle version was somehow translated from the printed version and these mistakes are hopefully not replicated in print.  The Kindle version is an atrocious one and badly needs to be revisited by somebody.",1
This is a little short but still delivered a great read.  Atlas and Nike are both likeable and their escapes from captivity are great.,1
"Elysia and Darien has been best friends for over 10 years...they have gone through all the bad and survived together the collapse of the civilization.  When things seems to be to get to the end point in ruined Baltimore they will do anything to leave it behind and follow a strange call that come in their dreams....I had kept unread this ebook on my kindle for ages but haven't read it before because lately I had very bad luck with this type of short presentations to new series.....but I was in a mood for a short read so I gave it a try..so glad I did...despite the short length this story is very well written and the plot original and well developed ( AND has an ending, that is, you will not be forced to purchase the next in the series to know what was all about; though after reading this one it actually did a great job as a teaser because I will definitely continue reading the series )Only 4 stars because I wish it was longer, it has great potential for a full length novel.",1
I did not care for it. It was not a good to read if you were expecting a romance story.,0
this was a strange book. i never made it all the way through.  lots of short stories. i think they were mostly exerts from another book. dont really recommend,0
"Really?  I usually like Lorelei James, but this story was just plain distasteful!!!!  Trashy, trashy, trashy.  Better to have a great love story with just Billy.",0
"I am stunned by the really  good reviews. They could bowl me over like a rock, they came out of nowhere, and they boggled my mind. This book is so filled with trite cliches, it could be used to teach students what not to write. Unspeakably atrocious grammar mistakes, spelling errors, misused words. Constant, ineffective, pointless shifts in point of view (yes, Dear Author, I'm speaking to you). Characters LOL stupid. Plot mind-numbingly predictable. Graphic sexual scenes LOL ludicrous as they shift diction constantly for names of genitalia and sexual activities. This is clearly self-published: no editor in his right mind would risk his reputation on this tripe. Too bad we can't subtract really but then that kind of honesty might scramble amazon's reviewing algorithm.",0
A very unique approach to the idea of cooking and perfectly formatted for the Kindle.  It's great.,1
"Great plot and hot, hot shapeshifters! The moments of humor were good and the deep friendship between the guys was touching.",1
"This was a decent read for the money. I felt like the story ended mid-swing so to speak however. I would have liked a more solid end instead of just the abrupt end it has. Still, it's worth the read...",1
this book was very enjoyable to read and I would read other books by the same author. I recommend it to anyone.,1
This book was extremely incredible to read and it had so much heated passion to describe in every Steele relationship. I'm glad that the brothers and cousin found passionate love at last.,1
"These books never seem to lose their appeal. We all know and love the film, but it is fun to read the book on which it was based",1
"Wow! What an excellent thriller!Parallax is my second fiction read by Jon F. Merz after I got a taste of his short story and I'm definitely hooked. This was an awesome thriller with lots of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I love stories that take me off guard and deal with complex characters that don't seem as if they're who they are, only to turn your expectations of them right on the side.The story deals with Frank Jolino and Ernst ""Stahl"", two expert assassins living on opposite sides of the globe in different lives until one fateful moment of mental interlinking brings them together. Soon each is allowed to view the other's experience as if they were perched on the other's shoulder. Their lives interconnect from jobs to love lives and betrayal while each have something in the balance. With Stahl, his son's life is at stake on the condition that he kills a scientist connected with the SARS disease. With Frank, he is sent to kill his old girlfriend, the long lost niece of his mafia boss who he still is in love with, on suspicion that she is connected with the feds.This was one novel that was hard to put down. Merz excels at creating engaging characters wrapped in a fast paced read. One moment I was sympathizing with them and the other felt the complete opposite. Overall, my nose was in the pages all the way to the very satisfying end.This is a late entry for the best of my 2009 reads and it goes right at the top. I hope Parallax makes it to the big screen like Merz's Fixer series is coming to television. I'd definitely grab a ticket!",1
"The Kindle 2 Cookbook is a must have for new owners. It goes into specifics on many of the functions that the owners guide just mentions. I particularly liked the email, IM, and news section.It is so convenient to have all the info right on the Kindle.",1
"The Bell family was haunted by a ghost who could argue a biblical verse, sing hymns, or belliger a family member until they went running from the house!  Written as a collection of individual interviews, various family members and friends talk about their experiences with the witch/ghost.  The writing is old fashioned and difficult to read.  The story itself is difficult to believe and modern readers should know they spend more time discussing the biblical discussions than the scary part of a haunting.",0
Stephanie Bond is entertaining and never into all the unnecessary descriptive sex.  She tells a good story without all the junk.,1
I stumbled on this series by accident. It looked like a good series so I bought the first three books in the series. I just finished reading Maiden Flight it only took five hours and I loved it. Can't wait for the next book.,1
"I always enjoy a great romance novel and Brenda Jackson never fails to deliver.  She brings just the right amount of spice to her books and they keep you wanting to read more, cant wait to get started on the next one.",1
"Dylan Gennaro and Abby Adler are on the run from their violent alpha, Alan Matthews. Alan turned Abby against her will a month ago, and treats women very badly. Although Abby is more of an alpha wolf and Dylan is much more submissive, he knows he needs to get her out of this cruel pack. Near by is Red Rock Sanctuary, a pack led by Gavin and his mate Samantha. They take in runaways from these packs that have violent out of control alphas. They get word Dylan is on his way, but it starts to get late. Gavin sends one of his alpha wolves, Keith to investigate. Keith is an alpha in the pack and has spent years fighting in the wars against the wizards, so he is good in these situations. Keith discovers Abby and Dylan on the side of the road, fighting off a couple of Alan's wolves sent to bring them back. After Keith shoots them all (Did I mention he is lethal?) he escorts them safely to Red Rock.They are welcomed and given a safe place to stay. One of the first rules Gavin has is all new wolves need a Guide, someone to lead new wolves through the first couple of months. Not only teaching them the basics of being a shifter, but the bond usually goes much more intimate than that. At the end of the Guide period, the couple can choose to go their separate ways or sometimes feelings have developed and they stay together to explore their relationship.As soon as Abby and Keith meet, their wolves immediately take notice of each other. Their human sides are also very attracted. Abby has to be the one to choose the Guide, and not forced into the decision. Keith with an overwhelming protectiveness needs Abby to choose him, but being the gentleman he lets her have time to adjust and look over her options. Abby knows he is the one, and when the sexual tension is about ready to burst, she agrees and the first lesson he teaches her is in the bedroom. But the fun ends when Abby gets a picture of her sister, who has been kidnapped by Alan. With Keith's help, they race to save her.Cry Sanctuary is full of alpha male goodness. The moment Keith, or I should say his wolf sees Abby, that is it for him. He goes into growly, overprotective mode. He stalks around, on edge, being a perfect gentlemen towards Abby, but letting everyone know she is off limits. Years ago, he lost a lover, and the raw emotions from that relationship coupled with his alpha status, make for a very intense male. He sees being her Guide as an honor, and the thought of any other male near her makes him almost lose control.Abby also exudes alpha status, and although she is terrified and confused by her new life, she is a tough cookie. She accepts Keith from the beginning. I like that they never refuse or deny their attraction. When they come together, two powerful wolves in the bedroom, it's a smexy overload. Abby feels guilty for having these strong feelings for Keith and for wanting him sexually at the same time as having him for her Guide. It takes prodding from both Keith and some friends to convince her Keith wants the same thing.We also meet the other wolves of Red Rock. Leaders Gavin and Samantha run a tight ship but are very warm. Joe, Keith's friend stays his friend after he realizes Abby is off limits and provides some very sarcastic comments. Abby's friend Dylan, who is more submissive gets a book in this series and I can't wait to see what they do with his character. I sometimes thought all the residents of Red Rock, or at least the ones we meet are a little too perfect. Everyone is so nice and welcoming but you can argue Gavin is a strict alpha and doesn't let anyone get out of line. This book is also on the shorter side so we don't get a lot of background into the war with the wizards but there are several more books to the series and I'm looking forward to reading more about this group. Although there is a satisfying ending, there is much left to explore.Cry Sanctuary is a action filled paranormal romance, with plenty of alpha action to steam up the pages.",1
I just love this series and keep getting more and more! Can't wait until I can get them all just love it,1
"Hot, sexy, fun!I can't believe some of these reviews--""it's too unbelievable""--it's a FANTASY!  As in, the next time I have a little solo fun, I'm gonna FANTASIZE about being Kate!  LOLI do want to note that it is implied that the sharing that goes on in this story is short-term or maybe even a one-time only deal.  This is not a they-ALL-lived-happily-ever-after-TOGETHER story, if that makes a difference to anyone.",1
"TheThe New York Timesis considered one of the ntion's finest papers, although some have stated that its leftist bias negates any value in the paper. However, a bigger problem with the paper is its size and cost.In my youth, I used to read about half of the week day edition in about four or five hours. (I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)The Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article. Otherwise you may loose the article with the next update.I have also occassionally lost sync with Amazon's servers. If your subscription doesn't update, just restart your Kindle. It will take a minute or so, but it gives your subscription a kick in the pants and starts updating again.I've been looking for a current news blog. Now I've found it.",1
"Very imaginative book! It was a page turner and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.However, I don't think I've yet read a Kindle book in which the author understood the difference between the verbs ""to lay"" and ""to lie."" This book was no exception. Example...""when they're laying low."" No! ...""when they're lying low."" Except for a couple of typos, these were the only errors - ""will"" for ""with"" and ""passed"" for ""past.""I thoroughly recommend this book.",1
"I can't say I liked this one, just not the type of story I care to read. It was, in general, well written (save a few very odd metaphors), but I found it to be awkward. The two MCs don't have much depth and they sort of stumble together and they didn't have a connection that I saw, and they just.....are there.I also found some of the plot points odd. (Small Spoilers Follow): Brock, who is the down on his luck model, made a sex tape with his heiress-celebutant ex-girlfriend. This apparently ruins his career. Hmmm. That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape (Thanks Mom!). So....I didn't get the big deal. The sex tape is described and it's not as though young children or sheep were involved so I'm just not seeing it.There is no HEA either, always a downer for me.Overall I just wasn't invested in the characters and I didn't buy the plot. It just wasn't for me.",0
"Couldn't make it past 2%; think there's only been one or two times I haven't been able to give a book at least 10%.  Action didn't engage, found it ridiculous that everything fell apart at start of story when the family had supposedly been hiding out for years.  Characters didn't engage, action had no urgency, writing was poor.",0
"Elain Pardie is a news reporter.  On assignment covering the First Annual Arcadia Highland Games, she is concerned to find a lost black dog while leaving.  Finding no one to claim him, Elain agrees to take him home with the hopes of finding his owner.  She has no idea that the huge furry dog is not actually a dog but a wolf. Nor does she even think to consider that the wolf is not a canine but a man.  When the dog's owners show up to claim their lost pet, Elain is sad to see him go but returns him anyway.  The next day, she receives a phone call from one of the owners inviting her to lunch.  When she meets the man, she is surprised to see he is a twin and that both men are luscious. Allowing them liberties she never even could have considered, Elain's life changes the minute they touch her.Ain, Brodey, and Cail are identical alpha triplets.  As such, fate tells of only one woman for the three men to love - their soul mate.  When Brodey smells an enticing scent at the Highland Games, he can't help but follow it.  He knows that Ain, the Prime of the three will be angry, but he is willing to take that chance because if his nose is correct, then he has just found the woman nature has intended to complete his family.I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Brodey and Cail.  Ain was the oldest and the most intense.  Brodey was the most playful of the three, and Cail seemed the happiest.  All three were sin personified and simply dreamy.  Ain's emotions concerning Elain worried me at first - he was so stubborn in wanting Elain to love them on her own terms and by her own choice.  Ain's willingness to sacrifice a lifetime of being unmated rather than force Elain to mate with he and brothers grabbed my heart and didn't let go.TROUBLE COMES IN THREES is sexy, scorching hot, and fun to read.  Tymber Dalton's ability to weave a story keeps me coming back for more and reading everything she releases.  Lovers of paranormal m&eacute;nage romances with a hint of comedy should run and grab this enticing book.  It was great!Natalie S.",1
"Otherwise, it would earn a 5.I like to read while charging my Kindle.  The short length makes this difficult.

"I can't say I didn't love this book because I did. I wish I could have given it 4 1/2 stars but amazon doesn't let you do that.You are first introduced to Fiona, or Fi's character and she's running from Colorado and Garrett, who happens to be her baby's father. Things were perfect with them at first but things changed after she moved in and the situation became abusive in more ways than one. On her way to Mt. Pleasant, TX she ends up stuck after an accident and fainting. Aidan comes to her rescue and it seems like he immediately falls in love with her. He agrees to help her get a job with his uncle and that she can stay with him temporarily, in hopes that he can convince her to stay. Garrett doesn't stay out of the picture long because he can't handle the fact that Fiona left him. They end up both agreeing to get married and go through planning it, and everyone is happy until Garrett shows up. Thanks to Aidan's Uncle and cousins he doesn't do anything other than yell a bit, and there is a very happy ending to this book.The only reason I didn't give the book five stars was because I understand it's short, but I think that things happened too fast between Fiona and Aidan. I understand she was scared and running, but it seems she gave in to willingly when help was offered",1

"Kilborn doesn't mince words, just body parts in this engrossing short story which picks up literally where Truck Stop left off. Donaldson's god complex, thirst for blood and need for complete victim submission come to fore in Serial at the expense of a naive hitchhiker. Kilborn teams Donaldson with yet another antagonist with a fetish for the macabre whose drive is that of the more imposing serial killer yet far more unassuming. Expect terror at every turn of the road.Serial delivers on its relentless pursuit to dissuade people of picking up hitchhikers - I will never look at charred meat on the BBQ the same again as I am sure to envision the vivid and overtly graphic scenes described in this story. Sublime yet sadistic and so satisfying - 5 stars.",1
"I found the warnings regarding sex, violence and (gasp!) Aussie spelling amusing.I found this short story less amusing. The point of view moves between characters to reveal a rather popular plot-twist in a more modern, urban setting. The different voices are very similar and only distinguishable by the names atop the chapters. I was rather disappointed.",0
"I pick this story because of the great reviews it got. Honestly;the only thing it was worth the money was the cover, and I still got jeep when the cover didn't appeared on my Kindle. The story could had been better. Obviously this was not for me.",0
Excellent book!!! Must read....Very good and love the detail of everything in the book and the sences and it keeps drawing you in even the next one.,1
"This was an amazing story. I read it months ago before I started blogging or even knew what blogging was. It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review",1

"I didn't like this story and I didn't like any of the characters.Jacob and Ray's son was close to graduating from school soon and Ray decides to go back to school.  Jacob hates the idea of his wife actually doing something for herself and tries to sabotage her efforts.  He let's his brother get into his head that Ray is looking for another man and not really focused on going back to school.  Jacob not only cheats on Ray, but after finding out he contracted gonorrhea, he deliberately has sex with Ray again hoping to get her pregnant.Jacob was a selfish jerk who only cared about himself, Ray asked for a divorce, but I knew that she would eventually take her piece of garbage husband back.  I thought the book would have been better if Ray had found a knew love who would appreciate her for who she is, and not for what he wanted her to be. I would never read this book again or recommend it for anyone else to read.",0

This is a fine little romance.",1
This was a fun read but far too short.  I would have liked to get more back story for all of the main characters.  It would also have been a more enjoyable read if the main characters had a chance to get to know each other.  I would read other books by this author.,1
"It's Docia and Cal's wedding as the back drop for Pete and Janie's romance.  All the 'Wedding From Hell' drama you'd expect plus it's still full of characters you love to love or love to hate.  Plus there are nice plot twists to keep you guessing, a few anxious moments that don't last too long and overall, a fun read.I'll give Benjamin props for creating more than once, a female villain that I just loved to hate (as in the first book).  Granted, while I wanted her flattened by a meteor or slapped silly in an ""Airplane"" like line-up by most of the characters, but her comuppence was adequate.Five stars, highly recommended with more of the same fun, quirky characters, cute pets, over the top small town Texas that makes these books a pure joy to read.",1
"So far I've read the first seven books in this series, and I'm hooked.  I'm ready to start book 8; all I can say is, Ricky Sides, keep writing!I've come to really like most of the characters.  They're consistent from book to book.  The farther I go into the series, the more sci-fi it feels to me, but I like sci-fi, so I'm not complaining.  I like the idea of this type of fighting machine and wish the US really had one--or thousands.In some series, after the third or fourth book they start to repeat themselves.  Not these.  They keep surprising.I'm going to copy and paste this review for the next five books.  It'll give me more time for reading ;)  I look forward to many more books from Ricky Sides.Note:  This is the darkest of the series so far.  The enemy is truly demented and frightening.",1

"Inside one of London's most exclusive clubs several gentlemen gather once a month to visit with one another.  As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.  I couldn't wait to delve into the rest of the groups stories!Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1

"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII, I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save, I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust, but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost.",1

"In something as short as flash fiction, where every word has to count, I simply don't get the point of repeating ""dark"" as many times as the author does at the beginning of this story.  Once you get past the annoying repetition, you have some pretty standard description and a ""twist"" ending.None of it really worked for me.  It came across as something written for a school assignment.",0
"Lady Amelia's Secret Lover is a delightful short story about a couple who love each other dearly, but have grown complacent and comfortable in their marriage. It is funny, touching, and clever.

"There have been enough comments regarding the content so I won't even discuss that.Several people have commented that this isn't long enough. Frankly, I think the length is one of the things that makes it as scary as it is. To take these 2 serial killers and put that much information and fear into one chapter for each of them then to bring them together in another chapter that wraps things up nicely, totally works for me. I also like the way the 2 authors worked independently and still made the story cohesive.After reading King and Koontz for the past 40 years and watching horror films longer than that, I really enjoyed this story. However, if you are squeamish don't read this.The way this was written intrigued me. I have read a few anthologies that are by a group of authors connecting their stories to make a whole. This is the second I have read where they alternate writing the same story and it was extremely well done.",1
"Blurb excerpt: Nothing's sexier than a man, or five, with power tools...Well, yes I have to agree.  Ask any woman and I'm sure she'd admit to having a fantasy or two about those hunky guys on the home improvement channels.  But let's get back to the story.Imagine if you will a young, single, good looking girl living alone and renovating a house willed to her by her last living relative that had past away recently.  What happened to her parents?  Why is she alone?  Why does she have to be totally mouse-ish and shy?  Why is she doing the renovations herself?  Is she short on money after paying hospital bills? What does she do for a living?  Did she get laid off?  Where's she getting the money for the renovations? One day five guys move into the house next door, who just so happen to be young and good looking themselves, with the intention to flip the house for a profit.  Everyone gets neighborly, guys give her tips on this and that, let her borrow tools, help her with projects,  etc.  Is the house in that much of disrepair or is this her excuse for spending more time with these men?  Sexual tension increases between them all in various ways but more so to the leader of the group, although no one acts upon it.  She often catches herself fantasyzing about the men...even though she's mouse-ish and shy.  Then one day...BAM!  This is the start of this story.  Only, there is only a passing mention of a relative leaving her the house.  No real back story.  So if you expect to get a plot out of this don't bother. (Or you could go with what I just supplied you)  But, plot smot!  The sex rocks.  Push the I believe button and just enjoy the smex, hot menage SMEX!!!  And of course it's got a HEA (happily ever after).  It's only about two sentences long, BUT WHO CARES, RIGHT?",1
I borrowed this book from the Kindle Lending library and was rather disappointed that i wasted a borrow on this book. There was no timeframe as things just happened and there was no telling of when they happened. Each chapter felt like more one story. This would not be a book i recommend to others,0
"This was a fun and quick read.  I enjoyed the storyline and characters very much.  I wish it was longer because I would have loved to have read more about these two.  But, sometimes we just don't have a lot of free time in the day.  So, this was a great book to read in one sitting.",1
"I really liked ""Containment"" and following that I bought several more of Cantrell's books.  However each one seem shorter than the one before.  This was would have been good had it been longer but this was just ridiculously short and even though I was expecting it, I was still surprised by how quickly it was over. There simply isn't enough time to build any character background enough to care about them in that time.The guy has good ideas but really need to learn to expand on them!",0
"I downloaded EYE OF THE STORM by Monette Michaels which was a modern action suspense romance novel and enjoyed it so much that I went looking for more of her books and found this one.  While I have expanded my selections of reading material, my first love is Sci/Fi and this satisfied my craving.It is a fast paced Sci/Fi novel with both strong male & female Alpha characters with a lot of fights and battles.  Wulf was the ultimate Alpha male wanting to do nothing but protect his mate but having to come to term with the fact that with her experience & abilities, Melina was not going to stay on the sidelines.  While Melina is a kick-ass heroine and capable of taking down the bad guys she's not invincible and does have to deal with injuries.  Too many times in a novel, the stong Alpha female is shown overcoming the bad guys with only a few bruises to show for it.  In both novels that I have read so far by Monette Michaels, the Alpha females while able to deal with the bad guys are not invincible and are therefore more credible.The world building is fantastic and believable for a Sci/Fi novel.  As for Wulf growling - enjoyed it.  I like a growly Ultra Alpha male.The novel is more actions and a slow build up to the love scenes and I really enjoyed that part.  My problem with this novel is that I was very much wishing that this was just a start to a series and that there were other books because I really want to read more about Wulf's brothers finding their mates.  As of yet, I have not found any more in the series but I'm still looking.Update:  I found the author's web page and found that while this book appeared to be a start of a series that no more books have been published or are in the working stage.  This I found rather disappointing because at the end of this book the reader was set up for the next book regarding one of Wulf's brothers finding and dealing with his mate.  It makes me wonder whether the other book EYE OF THE STORM will suffer the same fate - a great start but no follow up.  This does not take away from the fact that I enjoyed both books but I did find it disappointing.",1
Okay. Please note that I am so glad that people can find faith in a higher power. Really I am. But I didn't realize that this book was a religious beliefs short story book. My mistake. Enjoy your lives. I liked the first story.,0
"Caitlin Moore is on the brink of finally achieving her goal of finishing law school and having the job of her dreams.  She'd once put off her own desires and put a man's needs ahead of her own but she learned her lesson and isn't about to ever let another man dictate the course of her life.  However, she fully admits that she enjoys having a man in her bed and it's been too long since she's indulged in some down and dirty sexcapades.School's out for winter break and Caitlin's determined to have a good time before returning to her normal life of responsibility and control.  The last thing she expects is to run into a blast from the past called Eamon Blake, an Irishman with whom she'd shared a hot summer fling while staying in Ireland working at his family's pub.  They'd been great friends with benefits back then and Caitlin has no qualms about reawakening that side of their relationship.Eamon made the move from Ireland to establish a photography business in Las Angeles after the death of his father.  He's in Seattle where he has a few shoots to do for clients but running into Caitlin is a huge unexpected bonus.  He'd had a great time with Caitlin in Ireland and he's more than interested in reestablishing the sexual side of their relationship.  What he doesn't expect is the sudden desire for their relationship to be more than casual despite the fact that he isn't ready to settle down.Eamon's only going to be in Seattle for a week so they agree to enjoy the time they're together and part as friends.  Only neither of them is able to let go and via phone calls and occasional visits they continue their affair long distance.  At some point the long distance affair isn't going to cut it any longer.  Will their relationship survive an ultimatum or will they both find themselves alone and heartbroken over what may have been?Lauren Dane books have become a staple in my reading library.  Her stories are character driven, emotional, and always a lot of fun to immerse yourself in for a few hours.  ALWAYS tells the story of a couple who is perfect together yet they live twelve hundred miles apart and the time they spend apart is wearing on both of them.  I was able to empathize with both Eamon and Caitlin's points of view and my heart broke for each of them.Long distance relationships are extremely difficult to manage but I love how Eamon and Caitlin seem to handle the situation so effortlessly.  The secondary characters add a fun characteristic to the story with their interference in Eamon and Caitlin's relationship. Eamon's sister-in-law is especially delightful since she seems to especially enjoy antagonizing Eamon.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"I have read reviews that are really quite harsh with this book but perhaps in some ways justified.  It is a little different to the wolves and kings certainly and perhaps even a little slow, and often almost convoluted.  It is also fresh and has some fascinating characters notwithstanding Drake and Raven.  They are both strong and bold, and Raven is spellbinding with her diverse personalities, and those in the background already tempting us with intrigue.  Once I got my head around a totally different world I found myself hooked. I say great reading and can't wait to read the next one but the choice is yours.",1
Stephanie Bond has become my new favorite author!  She is really great at bringing a story together and keeping you hanging on to the end.  I find it hard to put her books down once I start!,1
"As I say in the title, I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious, I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such, I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper), I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle. I'm thoroughly loving this.",1
"I like dragons, and this was a free download, so I gave it a try. Aside from needing editing (or at least some proofreading) to clear up the clunky storytelling, I found myself disappointed. The story starts slow, works up unevenly to a burst of action... only to end not with a conclusion, but with an out-of-the-blue jump into the premise of the Dragonseer Saga series. That was halfway through the download: the other half turned out to be a preview of the first full-length Dragoneers book. Even knowing that it was a prequel, even knowing that it was a novella, I'd hoped for a more complete, self-contained tale, not what amounted to an overlong Prologue. I didn't bother with the preview; if this novella is an accurate indicator of the author's style and sense of story, I already know the Dragonseer Saga won't be on my reading list anytime soon.",0
"I first heard of She's Got Balls a few months ago and couldn't stop laughing at the title. When I decided to do M/M month, this book was at the top of my ""buy"" list. I haven't read anything by Mia Watts before She's Got Balls, but I will certainly be reading much more by this author:Chris Tarpington is a rookie cop on his first undercover operation; problem is, he's got to act like the female half of a married couple. He decides he's going to make the other cop play the role of the wife, until he meets him - Dective Vincent Pilk is super-tall, super-buff, and super-gorgeous.Chris is gay but not out to the Force, so when they're on assignment and Pilk kisses him as part of the role they're playing...it takes his breath away. Of course, it's a bit uncomfortable when you're aroused and your ""junk"" is stuffed into a pair ofpantyhose! He doesn't want Pilk to know he has feelings for him, until one evening when they have to practice being ""natural"" in front of their targets....I don't usually read short stories, and She's Got Balls is a perfect example of why - I wanted more!!! She's Got Balls was funny and sexy and I enjoyed every minute of it. Chris was so funny and chatty and completely head-over-heels for Pilk, and Pilk was silent and broody and sexy as hell. This was one book I did not want to put down!",1
I enjoyed all the books on this series that I have read so far. It is fantastic and fun to read. I can not wait to get hold on the next one.,1
This is a short short story that I assume sets the scene for future stories and it does this really well. You get a good picture of the club and what it's like and who it's for. It  introduces the characters. We first meet Brett and Lisa and find out a bit about them and how they feel about one another and then Leo enters the mix. We find out Lisa and Leo have a past. The three spend the night together which manages to not just be hot but tender and loving as well. The story ends with their journey together beginning. It was well done. A good read.,1
"I started out liking this book--the disfigured Magnus and the not so beautiful Agatha seemed to be good characters.  However, it was too much of the same old same old with their thoughts not being said, and them misunderstanding each other because of lack of communication.The whole killing scene was absolutely ridiculous--and I definitely figured out who was after Agatha way before anything happened.What was the point of the friend from America, Katherine?  She didn't add anything to the plot at all.  She was just extra conversation with Magnus' friend, George.Don't waste your time reading this.",0
I love the stories with Chewie in them! this e-book is no exception. great character introductions and wonderful story line.,1
"I read a lot, and it is really rare for me to not want to finish a book. I did finish this one, but I think only because I knew it was so short so it would be over soon. Part of the awkwardness I felt reading this book might be from culture differences, as this story took place in England and was written as such. I'm in the medical profession and had a really hard time with a lot of the British medical phrasing and can imagine an American layperson would be all that more confused. I've never seen so many exclamation points used in conversations before - I kept thinking that these people must be shouting at each other all the time! The romance felt very forced - I felt almost no chemistry between the main characters. Lorna (the ""heroine"") was going through a lot and had been through a lot, but I felt almost zero sympathy for her because all I could think was what a wimp she was. She complained about her job, she complained about her pain, she complained about her parents - she was just a miserable person. The one shining light was James - who was such a genuinely likable character, and who actually stood up for himself it made me like him more - and I was happy he got his happy ending. Even if it was with Lorna. 2/5 stars.",0
This was a DNF for me. I found the laguage stiff & unrealistic. I'll wait for Cherise Sinclaire's next offering. Based on this I'm  not a fan of Ms. Bradford.,0

"Studing the Old Testament can be confusing but with this excellent study guide, I am able to understand the symbols, and at times confusing narrative from the Bible.  Only one problem with it.  The Scripture itself is a good font, but the comments are in a much smaller font, and it is hard to read the comments.",1
"Love this author and ALL of her books, as an avid PNR reader I recommend this book and any others by her!!!  :)",1
At first I was disappointed that this was broken up into separate stories till I realized each story tied together with the same characters adding a new character each story.  I absolutely loved this book.,1
"This book was inspired by the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who survived alone for almost five years on an uninhabited island off the coast of Chile.It is a very interesting story with a lot of imagination by Verne as it is written in the later 1800s. It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale. Hard to always appreciate that it was written in 1870, as it has aged well.  An enjoyable Verne adventure novel, certainly one of his best.",1
"The first book in the Blurred Trilogy and part of The Demon Age series is set in the future after a demon apocalypse and is full of suspense, action, vampires, demons and romance.I found myself intrigued with this book right from the beginning.  It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.  This was a fantastic story and I will be reading more of the books in this series.",1
Great read awesome story line and did have a little miracle give the book more flavor. Would read this again,1
"This is one of the top 5 Harlequin Presents books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them. I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did. I am so glad that I took a chance at buying this book.I highly recommend this book, especially to those who are tired of the same old Harlequin plots.",1

"When a child of a prophesy is born, what do you do?  Exactly what her dragon guardian does.  She grows up protected, loved and nourished with knowledge.  Still to young to be told the truth of her birth, she is slowly taught the way of dragon's and humans, still not knowing what humans are and what happened to them.  She goes to school and learns what we all know, there are bullies in this world. She eventually learns a little bit of patience and how to control her temper.  All said, it is a well rounded story of a very important young persons life.  A well written story I can recommend to anyone.",1
"First of all this story was super short, not well structured and there was almost literally no character development. I get it's a short story but really, most of the erotica short stories I've read on my Kindle lately have at least a hint, but this one has none. Don't waste your money if this one's not free. And if it is? Don't waste your time.***SPOILER ALERT***The fudge thing? Not too bad... UNTIL it got to Mr. Stranger shoving up into certain feminine orifices.... Yeah no...",0
"Langley never fails to deliver. I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases. Dev is a reluctant hero, rising to the occasion to save his mate, Lainey, from an abusive alpha. Lainey is a spunky, cute, klutz who keeps his handsome mate, and the reader, laughing and groaning in turns at his antics. This fast-paced, sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This one has a permanent place on my reader, because once wasn't enough.",1
"As I began reading this book, I was drawn to the plight of Anna.  Anna is a fifteen year old girl who suffers from epilepsy.  She is unable to live a normal life due to the severity of her seizures.  Unfortunately, as I continued reading, a feeling of undeveloped characters distracted me from Anna's situation.  Her family members are not realistically described, nor were other characters in the story.  The killer in the story was a disappointment, as it seemed his thoughts and action were not given enough attention by the author.  It almost felt like the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into her characters, which caused me to be unable to develop any feelings about them.  I felt that the description of the surgery to separate the two halves of Anna's brain was descriptive and it is obvious the author did her research.  However, although the story line was fast paced, the situations were not transitioned into well.  The love interest between (nope, won't spoil it) seemed to be added on to the story as an afterthought.  I received a free copy of this book so I could review it.  I would not recommend it to other readers who enjoy getting drawn into a book and becoming emeshed in the characters and story line.",0
"Just finished Teri Barnett's ""Through The Mist of Time. As a fan of time travel I found it a little slow starting with a predicable plot line.  A a modern woman of the 18th century who had studied roman history Valerie should have been more aware of the events she finds herself in.",0
"This is a well written, entertaining story that will keep engaged through out. It is why reading is such a pleasure.",1

"Cougar Falls is in trouble - the Totem's Protector has died and the Totem has disappeared.  The town's hope lies in the Protector's niece... who knows nothing about the paranormal world her aunt lived in.This story gives you a quick insight into how Rachel becomes the new Protector and thus gains four Protectors herself.  There is some m/f/m/m action in this so if that puts you off then just don't bother reading it.  As for myself, I copied Dean and Grady and thoroughly enjoyed it as it &#34;was for one night only&#34;!As this is a Novella, don't expect a book that gives the amount of description that Tolkein would!  However, saying that, the amount of description given in this book is astounding - the town, the people, the rivalries, it's all there in your mind as you read through this little gem of a novella.If you want something that is short and spicy - and you don't mind a foursome - then definitely give this one a go.  A good introduction to a new series for me to look out for.",1
"Bulldog Drummond and his team hold the fates of nations in their hands as they race to stop evil perpetrators of doom!Older writing style, but still good stories!",1

I wonder if it will catch on in real life. Lol,1
"This is the fifth book in the original six book Lost Fleet series.  I consider this to be the best Space Opera series which I have read.  After 4 books of tactical genius and reasoned risks, Captain Geary and the Alliance Fleet are within a handful of jumps to Alliance space.  Captain Geary struggles as the risks seem more tangible as their final destination seems so close.  Fleet opponents become more desperate as they realize that there is little time to displace Captain Geary.  The Syndics are not content to be counted out and still have some cards to play on the seemingly invincible Alliance fleet.  Many plot lines come to epic conclusion in this book which I find has the best ending of any of the books in the original Lost Fleet series.Each book builds on the previous so it is important to read the books in order.  The first Lost Fleet Series consists ofThe Lost Fleet: Dauntless,The Lost Fleet: Fearless,The Lost Fleet: Courageous,The Lost Fleet: Valiant,The Lost Fleet: RelentlessandThe Lost Fleet: Victorious.  Author has also started a new series,The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier: Invincible, in the same universe.The Lost Fleet: Relentless is 4,548 Kindle locations long.  Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.  Longer novels can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.",1
"Fortune's Promise is the second story in the Fortune series, but it definitely wasn't my favourite (no need to read them in order, they are stand alone stories). I say that because I'm not really a fan of the ""famous person"" fantasy so I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the other two stories. Maddie, awestruck and helpless, falls under superstar Tanner's emotional and sensual spell...blah blah blah. Flying her out to see him? Buying her jewellery? At that point I stopped scrutinizing because there was no point.Putting aside my ever present pessimism, this book was pretty steamy and well written. Don't be swayed by me not liking the plot. I don't regret buying it, I rather like the way this author writes!Language: ExplicitLove Scenes: 5+Romance/Heat Factor Between Two Main Characters: Pretty hot, they're totally gaga for each other, as per the normOverall Rating: 3.5 Stars (Just because of the plot)",1

"The imagination of J. Morgan and his ability to spin magic into his story amazed me. This genre is new to me, but now that I know how much fun it is to spend time with his characters I plan on reading the rest of the series. It's a fast read and one that had me chuckling outloud in places and serious in others. He blends his characters into and exciting plot and certainly satisfies his readers in the end. I highly recommend others to read Love at First Stake.",1
This was a sexy new twist to the age old story of beauty and the beast. Each character was nicely done and the story moved at a fast well written pace.,1
I thought this book would help improve on my digital skills.  Not the case.  The author gives a few good pieces of information...but very few.,0
This is a great book that you just can't put down.... a very good fairy tale :)  and lots of steamy pages !!,1
"This is the first book I've read by this author, but it won't be the last.  The story was well written with plently of back story and developed characters.  I love that the pace of the romance was built up nicely and the characters didn't all jump into bed together after only 3 pages.  The story was also fairly long, so you don't feel cheated :)",1
ok read. could of been more three way action. but written good can't complain. I would read another one of her books.,0
"I really don't like to give such a low rating but if I only have 5 stars to give and I compare it to what I have been reading, I just can't give any more than 1 star.  I can't believe Joe McKinney gave this book praise.  It's not even a book.  It is 12 pages of a book.  Maybe people are reviewing the book Hungry,  I read that this is the first chapter of that book.  This didn't do it for me at all.",0
"I understand the point of view this story was told in, I really do. But goodness, it could have been told better. I didn't expect much with so little pages, but I guess I expected more than what was given to me.This is the story of a woman recalling her life with her enormous breasts from her days as a slutty teen to when she got them removed because of cancer. It was terrible. Not only was the descriptions awful but the story itself was just terrible. No emotional content. No real consistency. No steadiness. Nothing.I totally understand why it's free, but gosh, Amazon should be paying its customers to read this crap. I literally read the first few pages, stopped, scrolled through, and wanted to burn this book.But hey... it's free so what more can be expected?",0

"Brock Martindale's good fortune has turned to bad luck.  His once lucrative modeling career and high profile relationship both are gone and now he's penniless alone and has no idea what to do next.  When he's just about to lose all hope Carey Lindenbay walks into his life and gives him a future to look forward to.  Carey gave Brock's life purpose again and Brock wants to return happiness to the life of the man who quickly became his best friend.I found Coverboy to be more of a buddy story than a romance.  Brock had a frat boy persona.  He let his fame go to his head and ended up alienating those close to him.  Carey was a lifesaver for him.  I like the camaraderie between Brock and Carey, and even though their relationship was sexually physical, I didn't view them as a couple, but more so as friends with benefits.  Dan Skinner has a fun writing style and even though Coverboy wasn't what I was expecting I will look for more of Mr. Skinner's work.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I have read some pretty risqu&eacute; and erotic books lately, this one certainly made me blush and say &#34;whoa! Didn't see that coming...&#34;This book is not for the faint of heart- know what you are getting into- MMMF scenes, role playing that might make a reader uncomfortable if you don't expect it. Was it hot? Yes- and intense and erotic. Did I get to know the characters--no. This book has a purpose- if you can handle the intensity, it will certainly get you fired up.Quick bedroom read!!",1
This book sends a great message. It is very powerful and shows how strong you need to be in order to leave a domestic situation. I saw myself in this book and cried. I am glad I can say I am a survivor.,1
This was too short of a story for the real horror to have the shock effect that it deserved! Would make a great story if it had been longer.,0
"Oh, how I loved this story (!) about a cowboy (Judd) and a veterinarian (Mandy), who at first appeared to have nothing in common except a rocky past and being neighbors.  But being neighbors brought them together often in fun, mutual problem solving, and love.  I recognized many of the relationships and family situations in this story as having occurred in my own life.  This author's depth of understanding of these relationships and situations and the resolutions to the problems that crop up in families is astounding.  I find myself nodding my head as I read her stories, smiling at some of the scenes in the story, and feeling sad with some of the others...but always feeling as if I know the characters myself, intimately.  Ms. Scarbrough is a wonderful writer. Now I'm going to read the rest of her Kentucky Reunion series!",1

"This was a really great, fun-to-read story.  This author puts emotions into words perfectly.  There was steamy sex, a groveling husband, a happy wife.  Loved it.Quinn McKay and Libby were in a wife-induced trial separation.  They'd been having too many problems, one of them being the fact that they couldn't get pregnant.  But the separation was killing Quinn - he'd always been the strong, silent type, figuring that's what he should be.  A talk with his brother Ben made him think back - and he made a decision.  Changes that had come over the years they'd been together were possibly what the problem was?  Well, when he finally got together with Libby and let her see how he really felt - and she did the same - their life together changed quite a bit.  Excellent read.",1
I could not make it through these books. Each one was worse than the other. I like this kind of genre but these were poorly written and not worth the money I paid to read them.,0

"From the first page this story is gripping with a strong heroine, a psycho serial killer and a British accent.  The plot was full of twists and turns around every corner keeping the reader enthralled in the mystery and anticipation of catching the killer.  For a serial killer mystery this author is able to present a unique and entertaining take.The characters of Payce and Gavin are flawed giving them a plausible background story making them believable.  Their hardheaded dedication is a trait to be admired and it makes them inspired even more to catch the killer.I was provided a copy of the book by BTS eMag for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.",1
"This is the first book I have read by this author and because I liked it so much, I immediately looked up her author page upon completion.  The story has the perfect combination of storyline, sex, and characterization.  I am a fan and plan on downloading her other books.  You will not be disappointed!!",1
"This book started off good, but somewhere along the way it got lost and went downhill fast. The beginning was really interesting wondering what is happening and who is doing everything. I loved the killers chapters and the way everything was slowly being revealed. One thing I did hate throughout was it was a bit too descriptive for  my tastes. Not horribly so, but enough that it kept making me stop and think really? Did we need that much detail in the description? It is one thing that can bug me. Like calling out every name band of everything - I don't need it. It always makes me thing of product placement in movies and tv - like is the author being paid to advertise for the brands?Besides the descriptive, I was enjoying the book. But things just unraveled about halfway through and the end...the end was just too much. Now I need to add some spoilers here so don't read ahead if you don't want to know. You are told how how the killer showed up at his house and he managed to get out of the handcuffs and get to his secret gun and shoot the killer, but not dead. Then when the killer shows up again he just happens to be right next to another loaded gun and he just happens to be able to again shoot the killer. It was just a bit much. My husband was just like what? He just happens to have loaded guns all over the place? Yeah. One gun okay - the shotgun that was his dead fiances....that I am not buying. Then I told him what happened after that and he was just like wait...the book isn't over yet? I said nope - it just keeps going! Really it went on too long. Like right after that maybe have an epilogue chapter where you sum up everything, how he went to get help and moved to NYC to be with the lawyer lady and how things are good now. I don't need to see him do all of that because...well because the story was over when the killer died. And the author should never try and write a sex scene into his books. It just didn't work. Yes, you don't really 'see' them having sex, but the way the scene was written was just incredibly awkward. Not the best way to wrap up a book, which is unfortunate since the first half was pretty good.This review was originally posted to [...]",0
"The feel of time and place are so well developed I could almost smell the salt air.  Likewise, the characters had sufficient depth to make what happened to them matter.  The only criticism I have is the environmentalist agenda, while appropriate with the story context, came across as artificial which tended to detract from rather than add to the plot.",1
Lady Gabriella is sold by her husband because she is barren.  Drummund is the buyer.  Full of sexual encounters between the two lovers.  Written with style and  increasing love of each other.An excellent &#34;Rainy Day Read&#34; if you have a couple of hours.,1
"From the description I was expecting a bit of madcap ala Evanovich mixed with some fantasical crazy ala Wonderland - but I found it unfunny and heavy handed. It felt like every page she was trying to hit me in the head with her copy of Alice in Wonderland (when I would have much preferred the references to have been successfully and skillfully enough done to stand on their own (I don't like when an author has to tell me because she can't successfully show me). I found the main character to be very stupid and unlikeable, and I wasn't able to sympathize with any of her actions.The only positive I can find from my experience with this book is that at least I got it for free.",0
Really enjoyed these books.  Love to read all of Susan Mallery's books.  Liked having all three books together so that you don't have to wait for the next one to go out.  These books had all of the necessary plots to keep you wanting to read the next chapter. Hope I can find a one that continues with a story about the sister.,1
"I downloaded this book as a Kindle freebie.  I liked the title and thought it would be a light story about an encounter between a delivery man and one of his customers.  It isn't.  This is the product of 1,000 monkeys banging on their typewriters and flinging poo.  Have you ever been watching TV with a friend who keeps flipping channels?  That's what this book is like.  The author stays on one storyline for a few paragraphs before switching to another.  It's very awkward and will give your brain whiplash.  A few chapters in I was starting to wonder if the author just cut and pasted several different snip-its from drafts that she had on her computer.  There's blatantly obvious editing errors and inconsistencies.  Then there's the ""ick"" factor - a husband telling another man to ""do"" his wife and a swimmer fantasizing about a ""golden shower""?  Gross.  If you've clicked on this page, back away slowly, return to where you came from.  There's better options.",0
"This was not what I was expecting at all.  However, it was a good book.  It sucked me in and I just had to see how it ended.  It was different, but in a good way.  Not everything in life is prefect.  But that doesn't mean it's bad.  Good book and I want to read more by this author.",1
"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER",0
"""Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.""- by Kahlil Gibran -4 stars.William Jackson is a computer geek. He works from his Minnesota home. He is withdrawn and rather taciturn. Actually, he lives like a hermit because of his horrible childhood. His safe routine is blown to pieces when the daily sight of an unknown woman walking her dog sends his feelings in a turmoil.Jenny Fitzgerald's sex life is non-existent. The only guy who wants to date her is a creepy man named Evan. Evan is her co-worker and a mean guy. And then some day the love god sends her...this yummylicious specimen of a hot, sweet, AND shy man! This Nordic god standing in the middle of the path in a snowstorm is William. For a few days they go out for a walk with Jen's dog Rosie. Eventually, she 'invites' him on a date...Will's obvious fascination with her, his single-minded focus on her, makes her feel beautiful and interesting. His fixation on her is a bit disconcerting but hard to resist nevertheless!I really liked this book. The main couple is very sympathetic and there are good secondary characters as well. I truly LOVED Chris, the gay guy. He was so funny! The dialogs were good and hilarious - especially between Chris and Jenny. The hero was so taciturn, there wasn't really much room to develop exceptional dialogs. Of course I have to say that Will's dialogs fit him perfectly. He wasn't much of a talker and he was insecure and shy, therefore his answers were always short. His demeanor was very endearing - such a sweet guy! And he didn't even realize how hot he was! The sex scenes...gosh, they were really steamy and both of them were heating up the shower AND the sheets. I was so surprised to see how experienced the hero was when it came down to sex. I mean he was a virgin. Obviously, he learned a lot while watching certain movies. *cough*The beginning of this story was superb and I was totally hooked. And it reminded me a bit of Barbara Elsborg's books. Later on the pace slowed down and the plot didn't move forward as I'd have expected. But suddenly I had to read about this near-rape scene and the plot moved at a faster pace. Again.If you read the blurb then you know that this book contains a realistic, violent near-rape scene. Be prepared for an utterly nail-biting, heart-stopping, and thrilling scene of agony. When I read this particular scene, I truly felt for Jen, I hurt for her and I told myself over and over again ""When will it be over and when will the hero come to her rescue??"" Actually, when Will came and rescued Jen, I felt a tremendous relief!What didn't work for me:The author could have exploited the potential of this story much more. We know that Will had a rather horrible childhood. This topic could have been explored way better and I wanted more background story about Will. I wanted more insight, I wanted to know what goes on in his head. Sure, the author gave us a few glimpses but I just felt that it required further 'explanations'. Furthermore, I wanted him to open up completely, and I was waiting for his meltdown in front of Jen. The main couple never discussed his being a `virgin'. Will didn't tell Jen about his virginity. He was such a sensitive guy and I wanted to read about such a particular and important scene. I wanted him to ""Break the Silence"". The author didn't let that happen. Unfortunately. That's my biggest regret. Additionally, the whole marriage proposal felt a bit too rushed - it didn't ring true to me.Loved those 'lines':[...]""Sorry, Will - force of habit. And you're way too pretty to resist.""""Try."" Jenny took Will's arm and tugged him out of Christian's reach. ""I still haven't forgiven you for stealing my last potential date away from me.""Christian looked blank. ""Who?""""Trevor? Bike messenger guy? Ringing any bells?""""Oh please,"" Christian scoffed. ""If you don't want me to steal them, then don't go out with closet cases.""Will's muscles tightened at this, his shoulder blades pulling together.""Don't worry."" Christian must have noticed the small movement. ""I can tell you're as straight as an arrow. The flirting before was just...staring through the candy shop window without a penny in my pocket, that's all."" [...][...]Sometimes, she thought wryly, talking to Will was like playing twenty questions.[...]Overall, Breaking the Silence is an entertaining and engrossing read. And please, Ms. Allen, I'd like to read Christian's story!",1
"The story line was OK, the characters interesting enough, the only problem was that about half way in they start praying for each other and asking for prayers. This prayer thing was inserted very randomly in there and had absolutely no rhyme nor reason.I did finish the book but cringed every time the prayers were thrown in. It was a free book which was good, I will however make sure from now on to read the reviews before hand. I guess I am not a fan of Christian fiction.To summarize: story line is pretty good, it is a decent read if you don't mind the random God and prayer inserts.I would NOT pay to read it.",0
"I agree with another reviewer who said that the plot was thin.  This author should employ a good editor.  The poor grammar, run-on sentences, punctuation errors, etc. were serious distractions.",0
"I stopped reading at 62%.  I'm not sure if I can even say for certain why I stopped other than I didn't care about the protagonist.  Kevin, Boltman, is either crazy or a superhero but there wasn't enough character building done for me to get anything real about him other than he's a geek with a possibly tenuous grasp on reality.  I felt that same about the other characters - the love interest, the best friend, the washed out actor (who's habit of speaking exclusively in the third person REALLY annoyed me) and the cult leader - I didn't feel any of them were real people.I found myself reading just to get through the book and not because I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters I didn't really care about.  I think the story line had potential - which is why I picked up the book - and I think with more character development this could be a decent read. but, it's not there yet.",0
Great characters and lesson about God and forgiveness. Sidney showed me how we have faults and its easy to call others out but what happens when its turned...will you have grace like Jesus to forgive and love again??,1
"It is hard to believe this book was written by an adult. The premise was a good one. The mother of an autistic child, Kelly, is supposed to be 28 years old. Her sole term to describe the teacher she is falling in love with is ""adorable"". I counted that adjective at least 8 times.Her ex-husband is painted as evil, and he is sterotypically and unbelievable so. Kelly is rarely brave, mostly self pitying and spends more time worrying about her possible future relationship with a man than with her child. How sad, that she goes home from work everyday and takes care of her child. I thought that was what parenting was.She is rescued by the teacher, and his FBI friends, how convenient. He fell in love with her when he met her, having just been ditched by his platonic girlfriend of several years. Several years of cohabitating platonically?The views of dating, sex, love and parenthood seem to be written by someone who has never experienced any of those conditions, perhaps a 14 year old. Don't or waste your time or money.",0
"OMG!  I LOVED this book.  It's hot and steamy, with a fully developed storyline...incredible that!  It's the first book in the six-book Archangels series.  The other books, in order, are:  Lady Enslaved; Lady Captive; Lady Taken; Lady Enthralled; and Lady Gambled.In this book, the story that unfolds is not only sexy, but also touching.  Gabriella and Drummond were in love twenty-five years earlier, when an unbelievable act of betrayal--which had me in tears--rips the young lovers apart.  Gabriella ends up married to Lord St. John, heir to an Earldom, and Drummond--who at the time was a second son of a Duke--embarks on a career as a spy for the crown.Now, twenty-five years later, Gabriella finds herself in the mortifying position of being publicly sold by her husband!  When Drummond learns about the ""wife sale"" he is determined to have Gabriella as his own...he's never forgotten his first love.  However, once he secures possession of Gabriella he is determined to strip her of her ladylike inhibitions--Drummond refuses to be trapped in another passionless marriage.  In his endeavor to release Gabriella from the chains of ""proper"" society, Drummond assumes the role of Dom, and demands that Gabriella submit to his will (FYI, I would not classify this as a BDSM romance, although it does include a mild aspect of BDSM.)  Gabriella, not privy to Drummond's thoughts has no idea of his hidden agenda.  She just thinks he's an autocratic male, who is intent on humiliating her further.  I absolutely loved this book.The story that unfolds is not very believable, considering the events that unfold and the fact that they take place in Regency England, but that didn't bother me in the least.  I expected--and hoped--to read some hot sex in this book, the fully developed story was an added boon.  LOL  I highly recommend this book.",1
This was one of the funniest books I have ever read. Stephanie is a very good writer but this was outstanding. I laughed so hard with tears in my eyes I had to quit for awhile. I did of course finished the book.I will always pick Stephanies books.,1
Stay with me was worth its price. But you must like menege stories. The guys Rhys and Logan are clueless as to what is expected in a committed relationship and keep putting Catherine as the bottom of their to-do list which makes her rethink the relationship. I've read the book twice and its a keeper,1
"I have read quite a few YA books and have liked them, but this one not so much.The characters seemed to be lacking in personality and were just uninteresting to me. The story seemed to drag in certain areas as well. I basically HAD to make myself keep reading hoping the book would get better, but it never happened. The 'gasping' every time Lia shed a drop of blood was annoying.Some people might find this book interesting, but it just wasn't for me.Book Hollow[...]",0
"East meets west when Texas cowboy Rafe Walker falls for the well to do Bostonian Cathy Fitzgerald. A weekend of hot passion leads to Rafe and Cathy rearranging their lives to be together.  A spontaneous marriage proposal and a surprised `yes' have Cathy packing up her city life and moving into Rafe's Texas ranch.Four years later Rafe and Cathy find that passion may not have been enough to build a relationship as their marriage is crumbling apart.  Will these two who obviously love each other find a way to salvage their marriage and start to trust in one another?Second Wind is a very good story.  Communication and trust is the key to a solid relationship.  Rafe and Cathy had neither of these and to add to their problems, their jobs didn't leave them with much one on one time.  Cathy did well by Rafe, and honestly she gave a whole lot more than she got from him.  Rafe wasn't a bad person he just wasn't on Cathy's level, but opposites do attract and that was definitely demonstrated here.  What they lacked in other aspects of their marriage they compensated with the strong passion they had for each other.  They were hot together but need to work on life outside the bedroom.  Readers looking for a good breaking up and making up story, Second Wind is a great choice, and I enjoyed it very much.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"OK, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this ""free"" book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured, what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future.",1
"LOVED this book, great romance, great charcters, a must read as all of Bella Andre's books are, she is GREAT",1
This series was the first one that sucked me into vampires and the reading world in general. I picked up Wings in the Night and just could NOT put it down. So many amazing characters and I just love it so much. Maggie Shayne never ceases to amaze or thrill me with her incredible books. Get it!! You won't be disappointed! :),1
"I have enjoyed the entire Supernatural Bonds series so far and this is another great addition.I personally love it when the story's main character is a dragon, not only because I love dragons but because there are so few of these out there, in terms of the entire scope if paranormal writing.As per typical, we have an Alpha dragon seeking his mate.  I loved that this particular dragon was an oldie with specific ideas on how he was going to go about claiming his human mate, only to have it all go to pot once he found her.  Living through his frustration, all while seeing his extreme enjoyment, was quite amusing.In this book, I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a super baddie to be fought off, run from, protect against, as ie usually the way. After all, a good story has to have an antagonist/adversary right?  Without giving away key aspects of the story, I will simply say that in this story, the threat was not against his mate but rather someone she cared about.  Even with that, I have to say the threat was not much & I was left somewhat disappointed in how that part of the story was handled. To me that's part of the story I usually enjoy, so having it lacking left me feeling kind of uh.For the most part I consider this a good addition to the series.  It is certainly not my favorite of the series thus far, and was more sex and ""me dragon, you mine,"" than it was an actual completely written story, but it was enjoyable.Given that the books are all character continuation (the same characters connect throughout the series in one way or another), I would recommend starting at the first book in the series.  This certainly can be read as stand-alone, but I think the entire concept will be much more thoroughly enjoyed (some of the characters, their abilities, their mates familiar) if read in reading order.I have already started the next in the series, ""Conner's Wolf,"" and I am hopeful that Jory will get back on track with a great villain, good plot and engaging story as she has thus far with the Supernatural Bonds Series.  Enjoy! :)",1
"I really don't understand how it can be dark enough to keep you from driving home but light enough to let you see all the minor facial expressions (scowls, hooded eyes, etc) that clutter this story.A boring couple that isn't already together for boring reasons (she's too tiny for him?) gets thrown together in a boring way and have boring sex.",0

"Overall this was an entertaining story.  I really like the way this author builds the relationship between the H and the h.  She did this rather well in this story as well.  I also like how strong her female characters usually are.  There is one thing that annoyed me.  After the h asks the H to make a bigger comittment the H pretty much freaks and bails on her, in Mexico no less.  After a month she tries to reconnect with him as friends and he blows her off again.  Even though this guy was not a complete jerk it really annoyed me that he strolls in on her and declares that he has changed his mind taking for granted that she would drop everything and have him back, this is after months apart and him telling her that he had gone out on a date.  She of course is so happy she takes him back without a single doubt.  GRRR!!!  I love this author but it really annoys me when writers take a strong female character and resolve the story by just having her forgive and forget so easily.  Especially when the h was such a strong character.  Even though the H concedes to her in the end it was still really annoying that she did not even utter any hesitation.  That was why I gave it four stars instead of a five.  Other than that it was a great story.",1
"Didn't enjoy this story. It was just odd & didn't make much of any sense. I guess the author meant to do that, since it's a spin-off of 'Alice in Wonderland', but I really just didn't like this.",0
"I had never read any of the Oz books except the Wonderful WIzard of Oz.  I'd seen the Judy Garland movie several times and frankly gotten a little tired of it.  I'd seen a TV movie with new characters but had not realized there were further adventures actually written by Baum.  These are written for children but everything is so fresh and new they are great fun reads for adults, too.  I'm only part way through the entire collection but am having a great time following Dorothy's adventures in the different worlds.  Not all take place in Oz - so far, I've traveled to Ev (across the great desert from Oz) and a land underground inhabited by people who are vegetables and not particularly nice ones.",1
"Though this is under 60 pages, i still found the story between Henry and Arsen a satisfying read. I like that Henry is tall and bulky yet shy and though Arsen seems aloof we see that there is a gentle side to him, especially the way he treated Henry after finding out his past lover had abused him. This truly is a very sweet and yes hot novella!",1
Got sick of being told the heroine was beautiful and frankly couldn't stand her. Was she thick not to realise that her husband was trying to pimp her out! Got the bit about the husband's condition straight away and actually felt sorry for him towards the end. Personally did n't like the hero either. Suffered an acute case of lust and called it love and the heroine was quick to drop her drawers to commit adultery and call it love too. Pass on this one!,0

"Catherine Cullen-Wellesley has reached her breaking point.  Her husbands have been taking her for granted and over the past several months have blown off every date she's set up.  She wholeheartedly loves them but nurturing their relationship has fallen by the wayside in their course to better their business.  It's their five year anniversary and she has some very exciting news but their neglect has her questioning if she should stay or kiss them goodbye.Logan and Rhys have invested a year's worth of time in securing the biggest contract of their business career.  Unfortunately the client keeps jerking them around.  In their determination to make more money they've lost sight of what's truly important - their unique relationship with Cat.  They soon realize that their drive for success could quite possibly cost them the love of their lives.It's been three months since Cat was last intimate with Logan and Rhys.  They've been too wrapped up in their business ventures to pay her much attention and she's sunk into a pit of despair and loneliness.  The men completely forgot about their anniversary dinner and then canceling out on their Jamaican vacation is just too much.  She's played second best for far too long.  Cat has every intention of going on this vacation - with or without them.  It will give her a chance to relax and reevaluate her situation.  What she doesn't expect is for her unexpected absence from their home to open Logan and Rhys eyes to the possibility of a life without her.  Logan and Rhys have made a success of their business but their marriage is on the verge of failure.  Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.  If their marriage is going to succeed they're all going to have to put each other first, but can the men really delegate their business to office hours only?Maya Banks has become one of my favorite authors because of her emotionally driven storylines.  In STAY WITH ME readers will be drawn into the story and come to really care about the characters and maybe even live vicariously through them.  Who wouldn't like to have two sexy men doing everything in their power to make sure you don't leave them?  This is a wonderful story that I'll definitely be adding to the keeper shelf - along with the rest of Ms. Banks' books.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
I like these fairy tales and share them with my children who are also fans of all types of fairy tales.  I give the author a bow for great story telling.,1
"I don't normally read novellas because I didn't feel there was enough time for character development. I bought this one because of forum posts by the author and the price was definitely right.What a surprise! I immediately understood the heroine, Tracey, her life, her feelings. Not only that, it was a fully developed story.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a great rainy day or beach read or anytime you just want to curl up with a good book for a couple of hours.",1
"Alexia Colten arrives in Jaffery's Cove to take care of her ailing grandmother.  It has been several years since she has visited the cove where she spent most of her summers as a youth.  When Alexia gets there she discovers things are not as they seem and her life is about to change forever.Jaffery's Cove is the home of merfolk, dolphin shifters.  Alexia is to become the new leader of the pod only she has no idea they exist or what the job entails.  Step one of becoming the matriarch of a merfolk pod find your consorts...plural.Joshua has been in love with Alexia since she started coming to the cove at the tender age of 14.  Joshua would do anything for Alexia and is determined to not become her consort but her permanent lover.  Unfortunately for him, so is every other unmated male in Jaffery's Cove.Anthony is Joshua's cousin, a docile teacher at the local school.  He has decided to leave the consorting to the other eligible bachelors.  Anthony changes his mind after he spends time with Alexia.  She awakens every protective and dominant bone in his body.Can Alexia accept her new role as the leader of the merfolk?  She is very confused by her feelings for the men around her.  She struggles with the fact that she believes her feelings are unacceptable.  Can she overcome her insecurities to become the leader she was born to be and discover a life that can fulfill her wildest dreams?Tidal Wave was a lust filled adventure from the beginning.  It had some very funny moments most featuring Alexia's wonderful Gram, I loved her!  Joshua, Alexia, and Anthony set the pages on fire with their intensity.  Alexia is a compelling heroine dealing with this amazing new world with grace.  Each character brought their own issues to the relationship and the relationship makes them better people.  When I read the shifters in this book were dolphins I was skeptical but my doubts were resolved immediately.  There was a romanticism surrounding the story that I absolutely adored.  There is even a bit of danger to satisfy those suspense taste buds.  Tidal Wave is a force of nature to be reckoned with.  I will definitely be sampling the second book of this series.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
I loved all the short stories about the various characters in Jack's life and Jack herself. I eat up any Jack story and this compilation was more than satisfying.,1
"what can i say, i knew it was short, but i didn't know it would be so good. it starts and ends in one evening at the desperate and dateless ball. H meets h, who is working security at the party. they share a mind bond as well as a lustful one, leave and have perfect soul circle sex.the story itself ended in a good place.i am guessing this is a lead in to a series of books about some vampires. they only suck a little blood occasionally, feeding mostly off emotions, although not a lot of time was put into describing this setting.the writing was of professional quality, formatting good, and i will be keeping an eye out for the follow up books. it was that good...but definitely left me wanting more!",1
This short story was entirely too short. I am unable to figure out a purpose for these FEW pages. They could have been incorporated in another book in the series. I am very disappointed.,0
"This is one of Verne's better books. It's evenly paced, with believable characters, and balanced dialogue.However, it suffers from the same malady as all his books do, that it was padded out with unnecessary facts until in stretches it tends to read like a museum tour guide.Still, it's an enjoyable read and also made a decent movie.",1
This is a great  follow up to the other books in Showalters Atlantis series. I think if I had not read the other stories first I might find it lacking. But since I had read the others I really enjoyed it,1
"I prefer books where the hero doesn't share the heroine with his friends. Other than that, the intensity between the characters was great as was the writing.",0
"This short story was marginally better than ""Bah, Humbug"". It also could have been incorporated into the next in the series. Even though it was only a lousy two bucks, I still feel they were both a ploy by either the author or the publisher to extract more money merely for sales. And, I was so enjoying the series. Since I have already paid for the next installment, I will read it. No use throwing good money after bad. Great disappointment.",0
"Yeah, it was free but completely terrible. If this was a paper book I'd say it might be 10 -20 pages long. Jumped from several months, had no clue what was going on. Never got to see how they loved each other - what made them fall in love. Nothing. Terrible!! Deleting it cause it's not even worth the space on my kindle",0
"Both of these that I've read we're good. Short, yes, but good reads. I think I might look into more of her books soon.",1
"I loved this story. It was short and in typical LL fashion, a little empty on the plot, but man o man, I loved the characters in this one. The female lead was a ballbuster without being a total nasty witch about it. She seemed like a normal woman, someone you would enjoy having as a friend. I enjoyed the way she and Tarek talked and dealt with each other. I actually LIKED her, which is sort of hard for me with LL books. Her men are really alpha, and tortured and so awesome, but the females tend to be the same, witchy, argumentative, and stubborn. Not so with Lyra. Very sassy, and very fun. A very fitting mate for Tarek. And him...sigh. I loved him. The things he said to her, the way he was with her. A+ for me. I thought that no one could beat Dash from 'Elizabeth's wolf', but Tarek is definitely up there for me. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five was because of the haphazard way the plot was tacked on at the end.I mean, I'd totally forgotten about the danger Lyra was in until the very end. LOL, and then it was rushed. But it works in this case 'cause it's a short story. Other than that, the steamy scenes were extra hot, the dialogue was fun, and the characters were very lovable. Great job LL!",1

"For a good portion of his nearly century-long existence, Leo Dunne has been waiting and hoping to catch that one elusive scent that would bring love and joy to his life, the scent of the one person born just for him. When he caught scent of Ruby Halloway, saw her bent over a file cabinet in his company, he knew he wanted her desperately and thought she may be the one. Ruby, who has had a crush on Leo for ages, did what any shy girl would do when the object of her deepest desire focused on them...she ran away and hid.For a year she's avoided him. For a year he's watched her and tried to get close. Finally, with the help of her best friend and all the charm he can muster, the alleged playboy gets Ruby right where he wants her, and when he tastes her lips for the first time he knows he was right. She's his. And there will be no more hiding or running.Unfortunately, just finding his true mate isn't enough. He's still got to tell her he's fae, explain to her his Sidhe mother and leprechaun father. Gently introduce her into a world she couldn't possibly even dream about and explain the benefits and consequences. Before he can even get close to approaching that daunting task, however, his father calls with somber news. A rival family has kidnapped his brother and is holding him ransom. Leo doesn't need to ask what ransom they're asking for his brother's release. He already knows.They want him.Dana Marie Bell has kicked off this new series with a lot of potential and the backbone of an intriguing world and fun mythos, populating it with personable characters and a couple of neat plot twists. I've long been a fan of Bell and have read and enjoyed her Halle Pumas and Halle Shifters (looking for more of that one!) series, and am familiar with her writing style and characterizations. I particularly enjoy the humor that she injects and how adeptly she partners humor with stressful, sometimes threatening situations, to the benefit of the story as a whole.She's done that here in Dare to Believe: The Gray Court, Book 1. I enjoyed Leo and was charmed by Ruby, who, despite her shyness and some issues with body image, was an appealingly silver-tongued quipster who was good for a cute, humorous line. Some of Bell's greatest strengths as an author lay in her abilities to write fun, bantering dialogue and provide appealing and individual character definition around a solid story concept or idea.The depth and breadth of the plot suffers, though, by this book's shorter length. The narrative doesn't do much to flesh out the developing story and too much of it remains bare-boned to the point of emaciation. The pacing is disjointed, coming in forced fits and starts, not always clearly defined and suffering from several awkward transitions. Creating the world for the series, then stuffing a satisfying romance and a dangerous family threat together is a good idea in theory, but that's a lot of story and there just wasn't room to tell it all fully - to the detriment of the whole thing. Bell has the skill to tell a fully developed story that satisfies on all levels. She's done it before. Had she taken another 100 or so pages to fill out this story, she could have done so here.Unfortunately, as it stands, the romantic couple comes together far too quickly for my personal tastes, Ruby accepts her new world and gets over a lifetime of insecurities far too quickly for my tastes, and the kidnapping plot thread starts, and ends, with far too little development and depth. What's most disappointing is that with the appeal of the characters, I wanted much more of them and was doubly disappointed for not getting it.And then there's the sex.I vacillated on how to classify the genre of this book. Technically, there's too much plot and story development for me to consider it erotica in the manner in which I normally make that determination. There are also, however, sex scenes far too graphic and unconventional to fit into a mainstream paranormal romance - or even an edgy paranormal romance. I don't mind that - I like erotica. The problem is, though, that in this book there is a sex scene that is so egregiously out of place and disparate from the tone of the romantic relationship, the character development, and the plot at the point it was introduced, that I found it jarring and distasteful when read in context.~* WARNING! THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD!! *~Consider the following: Ruby is very, very shy and sexually inexperienced. Leo has convinced her to go with him across the country because his brother has been kidnapped and he needs to be with his family. He's desperate for her as his mate but desperate to help his brother. He's nervous about telling Ruby he's not human and knows he still needs to do that. Ruby gets to his parent's house and not only is completely overwhelmed by the choices she made to get her to that point, but nearly has a fit when his parents put her in the same room with Leo. She's accosted by the family who kidnapped his brother and Leo bonds with her. The bonding knocks her out for two days and Leo is terrified for her. When she finally wakes up Leo is so relieved that he...grabs the small, sex toy-filled suitcase he brought with him (packing sex toys is, of course, the first thing I think about when I learn my brother has been kidnapped and know it's because of me), unpacks an alarming number of them, blindfolds and handcuffs Ruby to the bed, uses a feather duster, rabbit ear vibrator, and anal plug on her, then proceeds to introduce her to...enthusiastic anal sex in concert with the other toys.Um...yeah...that didn't really work for me. On any level. At all.Had it been a different couple, in a different scenario, at a different time, with a different story going on around them, it would have been a sexy good time had by all. Bell writes sizzling fun sex scenes. There were just way too many things that made that scene inappropriate for this book. When I combine that with the anemic plot development and disjointed pacing of the narrative, the potential of the book went unrealized and I ended up not caring for it. I liked the characters very much...but unfortunately it wasn't quite enough.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",0
"I agree with the other reviewer that wrote that this story reads like a 70s porn. And I really think it was written by a guy, because I don't know any woman that would fantasize about the stuff in here.In addition, it was ridiculously short, and even with that there were proofreading errors:""His hands reaches up and caressed by titties..."" and line spacing where it shouldn't be.",0
"I don't realize at the time of getting this that it was a short story. So the story seemed rushed but the worst part was the ending. It wasn't even tragic, just stupidity.",0
"This book was very well written and had an interesting plot in the first 1/3 of the book. THEN: the big ""secret"" is revealed about the hero- and it all goes down hill from there.  I've read many time-travel romance books, and this one had a lot going for it, until it went in a totally weird and skin-crawling icky direction.  I won't post a spoiler in my review- but lets just say that the hero misleads the girl and by the time the ""secret"" is revealed, you will be grossed out.  I was so disgusted, I couldn't read anymore.",0
"Do not waste your time.  I purchased this for my 13 year old and was shocked at how many F-bombs were in it.  I immediately deleted it from my kindle.  I am ok with occasional cussing within a book, however this was all the time and there was no rational placement of it, it was simply to say the word.",0
"MadnessLet me start off by getting the bad news out of the way, telling you what issues I had with Madness, by Sorcha MacMurrough:Sweet Lord, the spelling errors!  I am more than willing to forgive an error or two in a good book.  It can even be fun to spot them, it makes you feel clever and perceptive.  Not so in Madness, there were so many, many errors that it became more of a challenge to try to ignore them!  I was seriously disappointed by this because it knocked what could have been a great book down to just a good book, if your willing to overlook the mistakes.Editors, help!  There were a few charactors whom could have done with more development, less repetition.  Along the same lines, I felt like the book could have lost a few chapters, sped things along and been made better for it.  Also, I have to say that I wish addiction and mental illness could be addressed in reality as simply as it is in this book.  Not that this aspect was handled badly, just that it contradicts conventional understanding of both topics.  Its simplified, I guess I would say.  My final complaint is the ending... without giving anything away, I will say that there are some remarkable coincidences and unimaginable good luck.  Something more practical may have been better.Now, all of that being said, I did enjoy this book.  I can honestly say that this book is very different from other romance novels I've read.  For one thing, the main female character, Gabrielle, is the hero of the story.  She literally and figuratively rescues her man, Simon.  Gabrielle is a strong, determined, hard working woman who knows her own mind.  She is not afraid to do what she has to in order to protect the people she loves.  She isn't afraid to go against conventional society norms and make choices and decisions that are right for her, what will make her happy.  Gabrielle was resourceful and stubborn in an endearing way.  She was the kind of character that you wanted to see happy at the end of the story.As for the Hero of the book, Simon... What can I say?  Simon is the kind of man every girl wants to find and keep forever.  Simon is smart, strong, handsome, loyal but with horrors in his past and demons that only his Lady Love can help him overcome.  Simon was passionate, sweet, thoughtful, brave and absolutely devoted to his Lady.  He has an insatiable love and lust for Gabrielle and he is determined to fight to transform himself into the kind of man who is worthy of her love.  One thing that I really appreciated about this story is the fact that Simon's intelligence was celebrated instead of down played or perceived as a weakness.  He's a hot hunk of man, but with a brain and a huge heart.While the physical relationship between Gabrielle and Simon doesn't begin immediately, once it begins... its on!  There was A LOT of sex in this story.  Tastefully done but abundant. The plus side to this, perhaps, is that the love that Gabrielle and Simon feel for one another is obvious and sweet, which for me made the banquet of sex less pointless or tedious.I would recommend this book to friends, with the aforementioned caution on the spelling and grammar errors.  If the small issues I mentioned were fixed, I would have given this book 5 stars.  The characters and the love they shared was solid gold, the story was interesting and manages to draw you into the dark corners that these characters visit, then usher you back to the light with the love they discover with one another.  Madness was worth the read, good enough that I'm not going to include a pun based on the title in my review.",1
"Wow! At first I was confused and didn't know what to make of Kaylee but I quickly got hooked on this one. Keep in mind that this is a 0.5 prequel to the regular series, so it's just a ""sampling"" of what's to come.  It may not make a whole lot of sense, but once you read book 1, you'll understand the reason for it.  Keep reading, give this series a chance, get to at least book 2 - you'll be hooked by then for sure!  I am definitely going to keep reading this series! Fascinating!",1
"Well, the prelude said it all. After that was a little embellishment and a lot of swear words that filled up the pages. I won't be recommending this book to anyone I know.",0
"Quite possibly one of the most boooooring books I have ever had the misfortune to download, the characters were lame and irritating the whole thing sucked. I found myself flapping the pages in desperation praying for it to end, Im glad I downloaded the free version first cause If I had been stuck with one that I had paid for I would have wept.. (dramatic I know)",0
"I was a little hesitant at first to read a book with M/M action.  I am pleased to say that it exceeded my expectations immensely.  Not only was it tasteful, but it was not the main theme of the book.  There is a lot of intense battle action between humans, vamps, and mages against the demons that are trying to infiltrate their world.  I look forward to the next book!",1
"If you love historical romance with plenty of steamy scenes, read this book. I liked the main couple, who went through a lot to be together. There were times when the words seemed too modern but it wasn't distracting. I look forward to reading more of this series.",1
"I am crazy about survivalist books, and that is what this book is.  The fog is the catastrophe that causes the need for survival skills, but it doesn't come into the story much.  The writing was very good.  The grammar mistakes were not overwhelming.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes end-of-the-world stories.",1
"The early stories are quite well done, but later in the book there are many I gave up on because they are revoltingly violent and/or not very interesting.  I would have quite liked to read more stories featuring the Jack Daniels character.",0

"""Dominant Species"" is an enjoyable military Sci-Fi that moves along at a good pace and had enough action to hold my interest all the way though. As other reviewers note, there are a lot of grammar and editing issues that can be distracting but not so much that it overly detracted from my immersion into the story.No spoilers from me: The story centers on a special forces team of ""United Systems"" Marines, complete with powered battle armor, that are tasked with a mission on a remote mining planet. The characters have very specialized functions on the team (Leader, Sargent, Scout, Sniper, and Medic) and the author does a good job building the sense that they are a cohesive unit. During the course of their mission, things take an unexpected turn and they find themselves in a totally different situation than the one they were sent to deal with. Also in the mix are an unstable environment, a hapless prisoner and an unexpected enemy.This was a good read while traveling and I would read more by the author.Recommended for fans of the genre.CFH",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It's classic fantasy - with a twist!  There is excellent character development through this story and its sequel.  I was not used to faeries being the ""bad guys.""  I was not used to ""wizards"" having fate dealt out to them without fore-knowledge. This book is a thoroughly good read as is its sequel and I can't wait for the next installment!",1
"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it Down.  It is definitely a recommended  Christian fiction that will keep you turning pages.",1
Great continuation of the series. Already read the book about Dimitri and enjoyed that one as well. Keep them coming.,1
"Wonderful book. All of Kallysten's work that I have read as of yet as been wonderful.This one took me a bit to jump in, and get the bearing and surroundings for some reason. I had a cold for a bit, so maybe it was just that.Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc being the Master and Blake being his Childe. The setting is in the future when Pacts are no longer formed or mean much of anything. (Pacts are where vampires keep humans safe and in exchange they give vampires blood.)(To learn more about Pacts see Kallysten's series titled The Pact) Vampires used to keep humans safe from the demons that roam the earth. There seem to be more and more demons roaming, this is caused by rips in the reality. Marc and Blake are looking for the rip when they come across some human fighters who are in need of assistance. Of course humans nowadays aren't as trusting and fear that these 2 vampires might be working with the demons. so it takes some time before a little bit of trust is formed.Amongst the group of fighters is Kate, who both Marc and Blake find attractive and desire. Kate is slow to realize it, but she too has an attraction to not just one of them but both of them. Although there is ground work set for more with these 3, there isn't much in this book. (can't wait for the next one and the one after that, as it will be about these three, but back to this one first.) They fight together and the start to trust one another, and slowly build more of a foundation.The vampires and the humans main goal becomes to find the rip and get it sealed, so they move on to a new town and start once more. Slowly making earth a safe place once again. There is hurt, and some betrayal, and enough lust to make you want more. Once the story gets going, its hard to put down, it just seems to fly by and before you know it its over and your wanting the next book so you can continue on with their journey and see what more is to come.",1
"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate, Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership.",1
"This book was too depressing and didn't feel like a romance novel. Before I scare you away, let me assure you that it has a HEA so this is technically a romance. Unfortunately, I didn't get it.Detective Inspector James McBride's life is a mess and he doesn't know how to fix it. He's forty years old, divorced and not quite at peace with his sexuality. On the professional front, things don't look good either: his current undercover assignment has him pretending to be an alcoholic and gambling addict in order to infiltrate and bust a human-trafficking ring, but not all the drinking he's been doing lately is exactly necessary to do his job. Needless to say, he ends up blowing his cover and is taken off the case.Reassigned to look after the visiting Israeli ambassador, which is a constable's job and thus unworthy of his rank, McBride feels an instant connection with Tobias Leitner, the leader of the Israeli security team. McBride should know better than to get involved with Toby, who's still recovering from the death of his partner and lover, but fate, in the form of an unexpected brush with death and the kidnapping of McBride's daughter Gracie, conspires to get them together. Can they rescue Gracie, defeat the bad guys, survive to tell the story, and heal one another's heart in the process?Phew, this was not a light read! The story had a dark tone and none of the characters was particularly nice. I didn't like McBride, I didn't get to know Toby well enough to either like or dislike him, and as a result, I didn't care about their relationship. I liked the action scenes, but I don't read romances for them.The plot was too complex to fit the constraints of a novella, and that affected the development of McBride and Toby's romance. In fact, I felt that the focus of the story was McBride's downfall and recovery, and his relationship with Toby was just an afterthought. If I had to classify this book following the rules I know, I'd have to create a new genre: women's fiction with a male character as protagonist. As I'm not a fan of women's fiction and having a man as protagonist makes no difference to me, this book failed to grab me.",0
"After working undercover as gay lovers for the better part of a year, returning back to their lives wasn't easy for FBI Special Agents Alex Ware and Shawn Matthews, especially when it turns out Shawn wants to continue being Alex's lover.  Shawn has been in love with Alex for years, but out of respect for their friendship and working environment, he never revealed his feelings.  Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be, and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay. This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive.  The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable.  Once the sting was over and they made their case, things would go back to normal, so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama.  Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it.  Who wouldn't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you?  Alex wanted to believe he didn't want Shawn, but he knew he would be lying.  He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him, but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay.  I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man, and Shawn's sweet, lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle.  Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship, they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other.  The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag, with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story.  I very much enjoyed reading A Matter of Necessity, a definite Joyfully Recommended read.Leyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"From the other reviews I read before buying this novella I thought this was going to be a really hot story.The hero said he was the devil & was going to show the heroine how to be really bad, so I assumed there would be some kink.But I gotta say I've read hotter stories. Yes the bottle was different but there was no spanking, bondage, role play or back door action. Was there even any dirty talk? I don't recall & I only read this book a couple of weeks ago.(not a good sign)If you're looking for a hot read try Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte or if you're after something with a bit of kink (but not hardcore) try Burn List by Julia Devlin both books took me by surprise whereas Carnal Ecstacy I felt like I was waiting for the fireworks that fizzled",0

"Very good for a freebee...Has a bit of a squick factor in that Angeline was planning to meet her kinda sorta boyfriend's son... and then has a passionate connection with said son.  Father was a cipher,  merely making things happen in the plot,  but Angeline felt like a real enough person. Alex was nicely tormented,  and very dom in a nice way.  I liked the sex,  felt the emotional connection and enjoyed this piece of erotica.  No master slave lingo,  but a sense of control and boundaries being pushed, which is actually what I prefer.",1
"Despite the negative comments, I read this book as a prequel to the Lords of the Underground series.  I am now reading book 4 of the series and I am not sure what help this book gives to the series?!?  The story was pointless and there was a very thin line connecting this story to those of the Lords.  Read it, I guess because its free.  But it doesn't impact the series at all.",0
"Look, I can appreciate a great short story and a novella even more so (gee, remember when novellas were just called ""short stories"", before they found a way to write even less and still charge us more?), but I am NOT paying $5.20 for a short story. I read the free sample, and would have paid $0.99 for the whole story, but they have a lot of nerve asking for more than that for so little. Really, esp. for a digital book!! C'mon! I normally wouldn't wrtie a review for something I did not read through completely (unless it was so bad I couldn't make myself finish it), but in this case it is not the writing I am protesting, but the publisher's expectation that we are stupid enough to pay that much for a short story! If we don't complain in the one way available to us that makes an impact, then how else can we, aside from not purchasing it, take a stand?!",0
"I love this series, but I can't say I really ""enjoyed"" this story. However, it is absolutely the finest portrayal of the dense male I've read in a long time. This guy doesn't get the concept of ""Actions speak louder than words,"" or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you're making a few mistakes you should listen to them. But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy's stupidity, as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books. On the down side, his ""little friend"" in this book (who pretty much derails his relationship,) also figures into the new series, Halle Shifters. I cringe to think that she will be an important character there, as she is selfish, immature and not at all likable. Unfortunately, she was given a ""special connection"" to a really great secondary character. What's with her and these ""special connections"" to the male characters? Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll mature some. Otherwise, I doubt the new series will be as enjoyable as the previous books. I do highly recommend Bear Necessities, (the first book in the new series,) and luckily she's unconscious throughout most of it!",1
"Drabble or drivel, it's all the same in this little book of depravity. Do you gawk at accident scenes, long to see the horrible wounds in the body under the sheet or wish you had a job like mortician or medical examiner???  If you answered YES to any of these, then this book is for you. The author seems to have a fascination with torture, missing body parts, partial or full decapitation, violence against women etc..  Importantly, he shows that he has empathy...it's just misdirected toward animals rather than his fellow man.  I gave it two stars, because it is difficult to produce tiny tales of 100 words, and he has accomplished that 25 times.  I just don't feel the need to debase myself with this kind of perversity any more often than necessary.  How about you?",0

Elle Kennedy is a wonderful writer!  I loved this book and have bought several of her other books as well.,1
"Okay, lactating women are kind of sexy. I get that. But, a book that is not much longer than the review I'm writing in which there is no character development and no plot to speak of? I guess there is sense to crying over spilled milk.",0
Linda Goodnight is a wonderful Christian writer.  It is so wonderful to pick up one of her books and know it is a great story without any unnecessary language.  She is tremendous and knows how to get the job done.,1
4.5stars -- What Do You Mean I'm Not Mrs. McKay?The worst part of the Rough Rider series is that every story whether it is a full novel or a brief novella such as this one.  It has you wondering if it is your favorite of your series. This is a peek inside Quinn & Libby McKay's marriage as they view and work to resolve their issues differently.  One area they definitely find their way back to is that old fashioned male to female communication with their bodies.  The sex is hot and the issues realistic as this short story could have been written from anyone's nine-year old marriage.  I connected with the both Libby and Quinn and we even had cameos from other s n the extended McKay clan.  It was good to see one of the already established romances after the wedding which is where the others usually end.The only difference between this entry and some of the others is the length.  The heat  -- it's in there!,1
"Robyn Maxwell might be deaf but she and her family have not let that stop her.  She is a successful baker and outdoors woman.  But she just can't seem to find a man she wants to date.  She does need a break though and when her brother backs out of their annual trip into the wilderness she decides to go by herself.  What she doesn't' count on is meeting the two others who are there at the same time.  She meets Keil and his brother and is instantly drawn to Keil.Keil is in the process of fighting for alpha of his pack.  He and his brother are taking some time away from the pack to regroup.  Keil never expects to find his mate, and in a woman who doesn't even know she is a wolf.  Suddenly everything seems to be happening to him at once...  Not quite the relaxing time he expected.  Will Keil and Robyn mate?  Will Keil win the alpha challenge?Wolf Signs takes an interesting twist to the normal wolf meets girl story.  Robyn is unique as she is deaf.  I found the premise of this story fantastic.  I love to see ""non perfect heroines"".  There is great potential for this series as we meet many lovable characters in Wolf Signs.  The only thing that I didn't love while reading this tale was there were a few awkward sayings and I did think that Robyn took things a little ""too in stride"".  But others might not find fault with these issues.  Either way, I still think Wolf Signs and the Granite Lake Wolves Series are worth your while.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
Great read for Jules Verne  fans.  A little simplistic in the details but he had to get the characters a long way in a very impossible situation.  Suspend your disbelief that much and he will lead you to the final scene that will have you slap your forehead for not seeing it coming.  Lot of fun.,1
Great cover and I had high hopes. The story started out good but then the cussing started and didn't stop.,0

Two lost souls find each other and help heal the wounds that have locked away their true selves for years.  This story is perfect in that it is realistic and shows how people can change for the better even if it does not have a fairy tail ending.  Real love can endure hard problems and survive.,1
I absolutely love the Breed books by Lora Leigh. I have only worked my way through about a third of them and I am totally hooked and maybe a bit in love.,1
"This is one of those instances that I should have read the reviews before purchasing this book; even if the book was free.  I agree with other reviewers that this is not an appropriate book for teens.  This is the first book with teenage characters that I have ever read and will probably be the last.  Free does not always mean quality.  The racial undertones, profanity and disgusting sex scenes are horrible.  Of course, you can take your chances and read it for yourself but beware.  Thankfully the book is short (127 pages) so the pain of reading it does not go on and on.  Good Luck!",0
"Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere was one of two books I got from Scudiere's publisher for review.  I read Resonance first, and really enjoyed it.  I had saved Vengeance for last because it was written after Resonance and I didn't know if it was a follow-up with the same characters.  I quickly found out...  it's not.  It's *completely* different, and *really* good.  I had a harder time putting this one down than the first.  I'd have been perfectly happy had it gone even longer than its 400 pages.Lee Maxwell was an accountant with a nice happy family.  That is, until he discovered that he was working for a business run by the mafia.  His attempt to contact the authorities and leave his job only led to the gruesome death of his wife and daughter.  He went off the grid, buried his identity, and started working on getting revenge for the killings.  During one of his operations, he runs into another killer, ""Sin"", who is young, female, dressed in leather, and an expert in knives and slow, painful deaths.  It quickly becomes obvious that they have the same purpose in life...  revenge on the mafia and other assorted lowlifes who need to be stopped one way or another.  Owen Dunham, the FBI agent on the case, has to figure out who the ""Grudge Ninja"" is, and why ""he"" is killing all these people.  But should the truth be known, he'd rather allow the killings to continue, as it's a swift and deadly form of frontier justice.  Lee and Sin have to come to some sort of arrangement in order to stay out of each other's way and maximize their efforts.  Why should they both spend time researching the same target, only to find out the other one got there first for the kill?  But Sin has her own dark history that drives her revenge, and opening up to another person is not something she's able to do.  The revenge killings reach a crescendo as the FBI starts to get their first real evidence left behind at the scene.  The question becomes whether Lee and Sin will finish their list before the FBI (or the mafia) gets to them first...The story starts out from three very different perspectives, that of Sin, Lee, and Owen.  And it's not clear at first why Lee is gunning down scum, and why Sin is leaving dead bodies with multiple cuts and slices, complete with crime documentation, all wrapped up (literally) in a big red bow.  Dunham has his own issues, as he really wants to get out of the business and take time to enjoy his wife and daughter before she tires of his demanding job and leaves him.  But once Sin and Lee start to confront each other, the story and characters really start to jell.  Neither of them want to trust each other, but neither of them wants to eliminate the other, either.  This tentative truce gives way to the beginning of trust, all to seek vengeance against those who have destroyed their lives.  I was also quite satisfied with the ending, as I wasn't looking forward to how I *though* it was going to conclude.Very dark, plenty of action, and character interaction that was stellar...  An excellent read.",1
I have really enjoyed this book and look forward to more of the series. Bob Moats has a flair for writing that keeps the reader engaged.,1
"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of the story, after that the characters devolve into kill this - run over there and kill that.I can't imagine characters with personalities as emotionally warped as those in the story ever making it to a mars colony.",0
"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lie in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.Flash back to 3473...When Reaper Bevyn Coure walked into the White Horse Saloon in the seedy little town of Orson in the Armistenky Territory, he was looking to do one thing. Get stinking drunk so he couldn't feel either his loneliness and the grief eating away at him over the loss of a close friend. The last thing he expected to find was the one woman who called out to his damaged soul.Lea Walsh was hard at work cleaning tables when the handsome Reaper walked in, swaggering, as if he owned the place, up to the bar and the whiskey bottle the saloon owner automatically placed before him. She could barely keep her eyes off him. Though she feared him, the sight of him stirred her desires. And then his deadly eyes met hers in the mirror over the bar. She watched his lips moved as he asked for her. She wasn't a whore, but even she knew you didn't refuse a Reaper what he wanted. When she followed him upstairs to his room, she knew her life was about to change for the better.What neither knows, however, is that danger tracks Bevyn's every move, and Lea may not have a say in whether or not she'll be able to keep her handsome Reaper once the Amazeen warrioress and Nightwind Penthesilea makes her move.In this tender love story, Charlotte Boyett-Compo once again weaves her marvelous magic to bring together a Reaper and the woman the Goddess has placed in his path. Lea is the one woman destined to assuage Bevyn's loneliness and ease the memories of his haunted past. Her own loneliness calls to Bevyn. Nevertheless, he doesn't want a woman complicating his life. Discarded at birth and raised harshly by priests to enter the priesthood, a woman tortured him and then finally burned him alive because he would not forsake his celibacy and submit to her. Then the Goddess Morrigunia thrust him into a second life of lonely servitude as one of her Reapers. To his way of thinking, Mo Regina is enough to deal with. But Lea is a temptation, one his lonely soul hungers to possess.Initially, Bevyn merely wants Lea as a companion, and although she's willing to give him more, she could definitely be happy with Bev as her protector...just as long as he doesn't make her into what he is. I love that these two spend their first night together just holding each other and filling up the empty holes of each other's loneliness, but Lea's adverse reaction to taking one of Bev's fledgling hellions wasn't a plus for me in her likeable column. But of course it doesn't stand in Bevyn's way of making her his mate. That he doesn't ask her to marry him however is understandable. How can he offer everything to a woman who won't accept every facet of him?Once things heat up between Bev and Lea, these two virgins manage to come up with some imaginative sex play. There's one scene set in a stable that will leave you panting and fanning your face! The secondary characters: Sheriff Buford Gilchrist, Widow Cornelia Jones, Riley the gambler, Lord Kheelan, and others add depth and focus to the story, but there was something missing from this fifth installment to the WesternWind series. Despite being highly emotional, which I always love about a Charlee Compo book, I wasn't satified with the pairing of Bevyn and Lea in Her Reaper's Arms. I just couldn't understand why Lea wanted to be with Bevyn if she found his revanent symbiont so distasteful.While this story is technically a standalone, I recommended you read the WesternWind books in order for better reader enjoyment and understanding. -- This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews, LLC.",1
"There were several errors. For one, when did Mercedes get married? There were references to her marriage & divorce but I don't recall either situation. And words were hyphenated unnecessarily, such as one syllable words or 2 letter words. Sometimes the story just jumped into something else. And for Rico to be so hard when she met him, he sure turned soft quick. And the story just ended with no warning. I will probably look for the second part but I won't make a run for it",1
"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions, curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter, more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect.",1
The story starts out and another Zombie story(love them) but then the author adds a whole new twist on the Zombies with hints and different characters and then the Zombies get smart and can gain in strength and intelegence.  I would say they are more like Ghouls or somthing like that where the more they eat the stronger they get.  I like the path of these zombies by the author and he only hints at the true source of the zombie infection in book one and Two(had to get it).  I plan on getting the third because I really want to see the story line come together and what these zombies are from?????,1
"I was first introduced to Rosamunde and Tynan in Rogues of Ravensmuir series, got to know them better in the Jewel of kinfairly series.  I was confused over how the author left them in the jewels book. I knew there had to be more.I couldnt wait to read this book. I knew it was a short story, but I bought it anyway ( only short story I've ever purchased). Since I knew before hand it was a short story, I wont deduct stars for that.However, after already feeling invested in Rosamunde and her love life, I was totally let down,  broken hearted and betrayed to find her soul mate was some one else.Wish I had just skipped this one!",0
"This is an easy-to-read retelling of an ancient Celtic fantasy filled with magic. Shepard is an award-winning author. He retells many ancient tales from many different cultures. These stories are interesting in themselves and they inform us how ancient people thought and taught.In this tale a strange veiled lady rides a horse very slowly near a king, but it is impossible to catch up with her either by running or using a galloping horse. She turns out to be beautiful, and the king needs magic to win her. The story is filled with the usage of the number three, which is characteristic of many fairy tales of many cultures. Beside this episode there is a second and a third, all involving this woman and the king. Readers will enjoy them.Shepard includes an interesting history of Celtic tales.",1
a lot of Bianca D'Arc since I found the first paperback in a book exchange store. It was Lords of the Were. After that I was hooked on her books.

Would highly recommend reading this series.,1

I loved how Lindsey was turned off from men, more interested in establishing her career until she meets handyman Brad, who pulls of Alpha male in a quiet, I can do it way. I loved that the characters developed a real connection and it was about more than sex, which was great. This book was fast-paced, the dialogue was real and it left me wanting to try BDSM with a smile on my face. Thanks Fox for another great read.",1
"I am a very avid  book reader and have been a beta reader for a couple authors. This story was sorely lacking and characters made little sense. First we have Kasie who was written as a woman firm in making sure she was no longer going to be controlled and manipulated and she is kidnapped by her former fianc&eacute;e. She does not know it's him at first and does nothing but allow herself be thrown into a car with a hat over her head and tied at her neck and she makes no effort to yell, fight and get away! What an insult to women! Then she finds out it's Chay and she does nothing still? Please! She hasn't seen or spoken to this man in eight years! She makes no effort to get away when they stop at a hotel, no effort when they are at the store later, just complaining to the store owner she's been taken against her will, but let's the store owner dismiss it! And all the time in the cabin she complains but let's him get away with speaking to her with attitude when he is the one in the absolute wrong and acts like she doesn't have the right to be upset and mad. Hello?! He committed a federal offense! Not even to mention that he committed a wrong to her. And no one so much as tells him how wrong he is, just is like oh, it he's a good guy and they're sure her dad has his reasons? Pahlease! The story lacked true character and depth. It fell too short of reality. Yes it's a work of fiction, but it still needs to make sense and it is a story of real people, not an alternate world or paranormal scenario. Tis was not a well written book. Thankfully this was a free read. I would have been unhappier if I wasted money on top of time. Free doesn't mean it has to be crap writing.",0
"I write this review after having completed book 4 and started book 5.  I do note that this and book 3 are getting negative reviews and frankly, I don't think they're deserved.  Missing proofreader?  Absolutely.  Tons of grammatical errors?  Certainly.  Improper use of verbs and nouns?  Definitely.  So drop a star off and be done with it.  Three stars is harsh, because the thing is this author definitely has the gift of storytelling.  It catches you, and makes you want to find out what happens next - and that's hard to consistently do in a series.Book one introduces Flare, who is of royal descent.  Without spoiling the story, Flare ends up leaving his kingdom to join the Guardians, who are sworn knights of a neighboring country.  The Guardians are then placed in a live-or-die situation that defines that happens next.I did have a few issues with the story.  First, the beginning part with his kingdom is totally glossed over: there's an early scene with an escort that you hope will be explained later, and it's somewhat alluded to but you really have to take a leap of faith as to what's going on.  There are no ramifications to Flare leaving the kingdom, at least not that I can tell, and he never goes back to revisit any of the people who helped him become a Guardian (with the exception of one person that he competed against).  In other words, it felt as though the author was trying to hurry up and get to the Guardians section and spend as little time as possible fully developing Flare early on.  We also never get a sense of consequence for what he's doing.Second, there are character interactions late in the story that feel random and contrived.  There's a death, and though we see a reaction to that death, it's totally blown off in later books of the series.  We don't get that sense that the death was life defining.  Trying desperately not to spoil things, but the actions in later books contradict the emotion that the author was attempting to evoke with the death in this book; goes to a lack of continuity and story flow.Lastly, there are too many sub characters. The author had so much difficulty developing Flare that it spilled over into the development of the other characters.  It's extremely challenging putting a face to each person and how they fit into the larger picture.  You know certain characters are warriors, certain others can use magic, some are female and some are male.  Beyond that, you just don't feel invested in the rest of the team.  It's as though their sole purpose is to have Flare not be a vigilante.There is an underlying plot that is reasonably well developed, and it is this plot that makes the reader want to continue with the series.  It's never blatant, never given away, just enough that you hunger for more.  If the author were to work on their character development and continuity, they would have a tremendous story on their hands. Regardless, it's worth the read if you can overlook the above.",1
I just have a really hard time reading about a timid character that immediately turns bossy. Maybe I'll try to finish later.,0

"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian, I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all, he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus, and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet, he refused to eat meat, eggs, and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God, yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife.",1
this book would make a great movie. i had high hopes because the book started out with a bang.  but then it got too convoluted with too many characters.  i am finally at 66% through and am finally getting into it.  before this book i was reading 2 a week and this one is just too long and so many characters its hard to keep track.,0
"Aislinn is a little girl with big dreams. After the death of her older brother, she decides to follow in his footsteps and become a lady knight. Her quest for knighthood brings many challenges and the temptation of forbidden love. Aislinn learns that being a knight means putting the Kingdom in front of personal concerns and helping those that cannot help themselves. In a journey is fraught with danger and filled with adventure, Aislinn is forced to grow up fast. She must stay strong and develop the skills necessary to realize her lifelong dream.With sword fights, passionate love, mythical creatures, and courtly games, Woman of Honor is my kind of book. I love the idea of incorporating real history in fantasy, and Ms. Zoltack's book is based on the real life story of a group of female knights. Blending history with fiction, her writing is full of plot and adventure and her characters are strong and believable. Most of all, I grew to love all of them and cared about their hardships and successes.Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong. The romance that blooms between her and the prince is well developed after years of solid friendship and teasing. I enjoyed reading about their secret courtship and had no idea how their romance would turn out! Ms. Zoltack has a few twists in store that will shock and startle as well as please.In conclusion, I thoroughly recommend this book for everyone that enjoys fantasy, romance and adventure! I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel, Knight of Glory.",1

"Sambodhi Prem, &lt;strong>Porridge: A Healthy Breakfast, and Cheap Too!&lt;/strong> (No press given, no date given)Points off for missing pertinent information (no press, no date, no page count).I actually only picked this up because I saw it listed for free on Kindle, checked the product description, and saw that the author was complaining about how he couldn't make books free on Kindle. That amused me enough to click, and now here I am reading the thing, and it's actually not bad. It's a single recipe, but instead of this just being a one-pager, the author talks a bit about the history of porridge, what oats to use, etc. Not bad at all if you're a fan of the heated oat as a breakfast food. Will be trying this soon, replacing the hotbox with my oven. Aside from the missing information, which is annoying, this is quite a good little file to have around. **",0

"Another great book in the cedar cove series. I know some were not as happy with this book as the others in the series, but I liked it. I like the new romance of Teri and chess player, Bobby.  It's a new twist for d. Macomber. Usually her characters are not celebs. And also chess is a different world entirely.  It's a great incorporation. I like catching up with past characters, I've come to love and the settling of story lines. It's a wonderful read. I can't wait to start 74. I hope you hop on board and enjoy a slice of happiness and dizziness.",1

"Sweet and tender? Not! Try stupid and tedious.  I don't mind menage stories, in fact I love them, but I want the menage to be within a loving, committed relationship.

I didn't care at all for the characters, especially a heroine who remains committed to a husband despite overwhelming evidence that he has no respect or care for her. I have deleted this book from my Kindle archive.  So much for offering a title free to build good publicity.",0

Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening, I'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more. The story just didn't make sense to me.  I had a really hard to time getting into the characters.  It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus.  This one not so much.",0
"First Kill All The Lawyers by Patricia Clark has great start but fizzles at the end. What drew me to this book was the premise of a serial killer targeting lawyers. What a promising premise, unfortunately Clark doesn't deliver on the promise.The beginning of the story is strong as Clark pairs up a grizzled street cop and a FBI profiler. They are exact opposites so the reader is set-up for the personality conflicts that will undoubtedly arise as the duo pursues the serial killer but these conflicts never happen because Clark regulates the street cop to the background of the story soon after the beginning. The whole story takes a nose dive at this point.As the story continues the reader has to constantly battle to suspend disbelief. For example, a brother and sister who both happen to be FBI agents stationed in the Washington D.C. area. A stretch at best but I'm willing to make it to stay in the story. However, Clark includes a famous country singer for a love interest who happens to have an uncle who is ex-CIA, who will conveniently provide all the clandestine help necessary to solve the case. This pushed suspension of disbelief to the utmost limits.The corny characters were bearable but what wasn't bearable was the ending. Clark builds the story and prepares the reader for a great climatic battle between the serial killer and the protagonist only there is no battle, just revelation of the identity of the killer.First Kill All The Lawyers had the makings of a great yarn then it just fizzled. I cannot recommend this work to others.",0
I think her main goal is to sell you her books on how to get into the greeting card business. Trust me when I say there are PASSIONATE cruisers who put their heart and soul into a cruise tip book. I have read them and felt like I just cruised instead of read soulless instructions.,0
"The story itself could have been OK, but the author is in need of an editor ASAP.  There were so many basic grammatical errors that it made it hard to read.

"I've had this book since October 2011. It's now mid-March 2012, and I've only just read it today.I have to say, for the first page and a half, I really did wonder what I was reading, but very quickly the quirky writing and the tongue-in-cheek hunour took over, and I was caught!Trolls, Vampires, a man who finds things and a neighbour who is some sort of voodoo witch crossed with a look-out... This was great fun. Delighted to give this five stars, and hope that if you ever have a few hours and need a good short with no pretence of the irony and curious humour that fantasy can sometimes throw at you, this is a great place to start!",1
"(May contain spoilers)The book starts out solid and interesting. Then in the middle everything shifts and explodes into a bad plot twist. When I read the summary and it mentioned gods I figured it would be figurative, however they were not. This author put flat out religious, ridiculous, prophetic god characters into what began as a solid space apocalypse plot. It's just way too much.To have the apocalypse happen in a dystopian future while also throwing in some space tech walks a fine line between a great story plot and having too much going on. The author was doing quite well until deciding it was time to throw the whole thing off a cliff, kill off a bunch of characters, add an unconvincing romance, and let loose a ""twist"" in the form of gods who are suddenly the reason behind the apocalypse. Additionally the main character goes from being a fairly strong female character who holds no belief in religion to bring a forlorn, love struck, weakling who laments death and embraces the ""goddess"" that claims her. Nonsense.The only reason this gets two stars is because the first half of the book was a solid story. Before it went off to crazy land I was intrigued and excited to finish the book. The ""teaser chapter"" at the end of the book promises that the next book will be even worse than the last half of this one, so I won't even bother. Sad to see such a promising plot get blown up in the efforts of an author to reach beyond the limits of their plot line. At least there weren't any zombies, cause then it would have just been a straight up joke.",0
"I am NOT a Christian, but I enjoyed the book because the premise is interesting. Some of the characters were a bit stereotypical (do we always have to have a gay priest?) but the writing was solid and the story held together. It was a bit &#34;too much&#34; to have Maria taking the part of Mary and I didn't really like her character, which shifted from cold fish to loving wife without sufficient explanation. Also thought the ending didn't quite hold together -- everyone clears out except for a couple, the female half of which just conveniently was a doctor, etc. Still, kudos to the author for carrying out this interesting idea as well as he did.",1
I love Maya Banks to begin with....she is a great writer. but these stories are great.....they do keep my interest,1
"I really liked certain aspects of this book.  There was complicated world building an array of unique characters. Unfortunately, the things that made this book interesting were also the things that lacked. The world building was not well fleshed out, leaving me scrambling after the strange terminology, not really understanding what it was referring to. The characters didn't portray a lot of emotion, which made it hard for me to really care about any of them... i was just along for the ride. The plot itself was nearly nonexistant. The entirety of the story came down to just this: escape. Survive. The romantic bits were completely glossed over. It was still an interesting read, but not one of my favorites.",0
"Stephanie Bond has definitely impressed me with her writing and particularly her character development. I fall in love with her characters almost immediately, and this book was no exception. Enjoying a laugh while wondering just how the main characters would solve their work and personal dilemmas was icing on the cake. Although the title might steer non-Southerners from feeling compelled to read it, the small town flavor of this book could reflect life in any small town in America.",1
"Ok, so I should have taken the warnings seriously in other reviews. This book was abosolutly horrible.  I do enjoy my romance novels that have sex involved, I'm not an uptight priss that thinks sex is something only thought or spoken of behind closed doors. But really sleeping with 3 brothers and having who knows which ones baby is a little much. And in the mean time while she is close to delivery she is having sex with them all or atleast trying to. Then the way the Author makes all the men gush over her like she is a fallin angle is sickening. They fall over themselves to please her, its unreal. The book only took me about 40 minutes to read and sadly I will never have those 40 minutes of my life returned to me, maybe I can stay awake a little longer tonight to try and make up for it. I hope so. I absolutly DO NOT recommend this book to anyone at all. The only positive thing I can say is that they named the baby Seth and that's my sons name.",0
this was an unexpected pleasure.i couldnt find anything to read and ran across this one and wow.well worth the time and money to read,1
"I really enjoyed this book. This book has all the greats, romance,fights, turmoil, and then the love. The author is great I can't wait to find more of hers!",1
The story was only fair and I was very annoyed because of a poor index.  I was looking forward to some intriguing reading.,0
"Everyone should have a Miranda in their lives.  This story was so much fun, and the more I read, the harder it became to put down.  Talk about good and evil being clearly defined . . .",1
"As a lifelong Christian (I was raised in a Christian home, was saved at 8 yrs old, never known a time in my life where I didn't know Jesus) I've experienced some very hurtful things in churches in the past. The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors. My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority. The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary. People became ugly fast and chased us, even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary. They literally ran us out of town. We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but didn't attend church very much and finally not at all. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church (and my Mom was the daughter of a minister). As a teenager, I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers. It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church. My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009. We were very active. But of all the pastors that went through our church, I could probably count on one hand the ones that didn't abuse the congregation in one way or another. Finally, we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church. Needless to say I'm gun shy now! We've been visiting churches all over our town but haven't found a match yet. I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time, money and selves into a body that has the same problems. It takes awhile before you get to know the church, policies, leadership, congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark. I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way. Then I read this book. I think the book's description is right on the mark so I won't repeat it. But, since I started reading this book, we've started visiting more churches and praying that we find one soon.",1
"Enjoyable writing and a good story, but too short for the plot.  A longer story would have been smoother and more believable.",1
"Katie McCormick is desperate: Her sister is getting married to her ex-boyfriend and has planned a wedding ceremony which is going to last for four days and the ""life threatening"" question is how can Katie appear at these events without a date? Her mother has made it clear that she is supposed to turn up with any man next to her and has made arrangement for her best friend's son to accompany her to the wedding. Howie isn't pleased when his mother orders him to help out her best friend's daughter and nearly coerces him to save the ""damsel in distress"". Howie and Katie met for the first time in their early teens but that meeting was disastrous and afterwards they lost sight of each other, however, meanwhile Katie is an attractive young woman and Howie is a successful and good-looking businessman. Together they face the ""dangerous"" McCormick Clan and the hilarious wedding only to find out that their mothers might finally have been right.What can I say about main characters whose descriptions is limited exclusively to their physical attributes only?! What about their characters and life experience that might have shaped their personality or attitudes? How are they as persons and how do they interact with other people? OK, I know this is an easy read but that doesn't mean that it has to be that flat. In any case, even ""easy"" and ""flat"" means that the author should be careful and consequent and with that I mean that at one point Katie had a long pony tail and the next morning she had short spiking hair! Well?!The plot was straight forward and completely predictable without any twist and turns, the romance between Katie and Howie could only be described as lukewarm. In general, the plot and love story had potential which was unfortunately not fully exhausted.The only positive highlight of the book was Katie's mother, whose dialogues were absolutely smart and funny.I didn't enjoy this book, which completely failed to keep me focused or entertained and lacked any shred of atmosphere between the lovers.(P.S. I think there's an older movie around which has more or less the same theme, except that the male date was a ""rental"" and not the mother's best friend's son. )",0
Other than the title ( which kept me from reading it for several months) I loved the story and all the characters in it. I really wish the title had been more appealing and I can't wait to read more from Jackie Braun in the future,1
blake crouch does it again. beware of quaint little mountain towns.this book reads like a scary movie. i can just about hear the weird music.,0
"For many years, Meli Galdes serves as her family's ""unofficial"" assassin, and she is a very good one at that. Her family's last assignment for her was to do away with Celino Carvanna, the man who has hurt her in the past.When Celino saw her, he didn't remember her from the awkward girl he knew from before. All he was aware of was being captivated by her, and he would do anything to possess her.I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.Though Ilona Andrews introduced a new world in this short read, the setting wasn't hard to understand, perhaps because it was patterned after the Mafia of our world, but it's more than that. The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her. I have long wanted to read a heroine who's strong like Meli and this story didn't disappoint. I was expecting a twist, but when it came, I was still caught by surprise. It was brilliant and oh-so-right for this story. Get this book, and you won't be sorry. Suffice it to say, I'm looking forward to more books in the Kinsmen world.",1
"This book had a steady flow, and the anticipation was building throughout.  Yes Liz was dead wrog for what she did, but in the end I really didn't see why she did it.  Darius seemed like the ideal man.  He had his faults,  but he certainly got better with age.  The book was great to me, there were really no lows, and it makes you want to read it str8 in one sitting.",1
"If there was ever a case for book classification this one makes it as it would certainly rate an adult classification. I am not sure if the author set out to shock or thought that the graphic descriptions aided the story. However this is not the reason that I am giving it 2 stars there was virtually no character development and the plot had glaring gaps in it perhaps as the author tries to put too much into the story. I am not sure if there is a book before this, which may have given more background, or there is going to be a ""prequel"" as the story starts with the reader being thrown in at the deep end.One example of plot deficiencies is where the police want to prevent a  remotely controlled bomb exploding so they decide to block all wireless frequencies, easier said than done, however they seem to manage that and I wondered how they were going to get over their mobile phones not working, no problem they just kept working.  There were many examples where the plot fell down which made it all very unbelievable. Had it been believable together with the graphic adult themes and violence it would have been a gripping but frightening book. Unfortunately it failed.The book ends at a point where there is obviously going to be a sequel, it is called ""Final Justice"" I will not be reading it.",0
"Having read so many of Ms. Kennedy's SEAL series, I was thrilled and LUCKY to have found this for free. I absolutely adore her books, and this one did  not disappoint. You can always expect a wonderfully true-to-life set of characters, humor, and scorching love scenes. Looking forward to her newest release!",1
I just wanted to make everyone aware that the number of pages listed on Amazon is incorrect.  This is a short story.  I looked it up and according to Barnes and Noble this story is 48 pages.  So just be aware if you order this it is very short and the product description is misleading.  It's a good short story but that's all it is.,1
"This is my first shifter book besides the Twilight series, and I have to say I enjoyed it very much!! I was already a huge Vivian Arend fan, so it wasn't too hard to convince me to try this book. She has made me a fan of a new, to me, genre. This is a really great quick read.Robyn Maxwell has a big ski trip planned, but at the last minute her brother, Tad, cancels on her. She decides that she is going with or without him. She is a strong independent woman, and her survival skills are not weakened in the least bit by the fact that she is deaf. Her biggest worry is that she will eat all 6450 calories of the cheesecake she had gotten for her and Tad to enjoy together. The chance to get out of the city and relax in the Yukon wilderness is one thing she can't pass up.Keil and his brother TJ had a nice relaxing weekend planned, before Keil is scheduled to challenge for the Alpha position in his Alaskan Pack. With a fight to the death hanging over his head and watching out for his accident prone brother, the last thing he expected was to find his mate out in the wilderness. OR to have to explain to her that she is a wolf in the first place. Language barriers aside these two have some smoking hot chemistry and sex!! HOLY SMOKES!!I loved this book. It was one of those where it makes you wish you would meet this smoking hot man, with abs for days, and have him tell you that you are his mate. Sign me up for some of that!! This book has some great funny banter between everyone. I really loved the sibling like interactions between Robyn and TJ, and then once the wolf telepathy starts between Robyn and Keil that amps up the hotness level for me. This is really a great book! I highly recommend y'all checking this one out!!4.75 Stars",1
"This is one of those books where even when you download the sample, you can still be led astray.  Shannon Stacey is capable of writing funny dialogue and the book gets off to a good start.  Unfortunately for all, this roadtrip runs out of gas very quickly.I`m not sure I have ever a novel with two such pathetic adult lead characters.  Ethan has moved to a new town because his MOTHER got a job there.  Unlike his mother, Ethan has no job.  We learn that his furniture restoration business was ruined by his ex-wife who fled with all the money.  Somehow this grown man was unable to take any sort of legal action and felt fortunate to still have a car.  What?  It gets worse as he is booked on a senior`s trip to Disney World along with his mother.Jill is a children`s librarian who seems to have big dreams that she does nothing to work toward.  Her family mocks her by saying, ""When the going gets tough, Jill gets going.""  Based on her track record this seems pretty accurate.The connection between the two characters seems more juvenile than believable.  Our hero can`t even say the word condom without blushing yet morphs into wanting anal sex in the last few pages.  Had the book stayed in the P.G. world, maybe the innocence would have made sense, but the change in Ethan`s behavior just doesn`t work.  Similarly, in a brilliant Dr. Phil type deduction, Ethan blames Jill`s lack of gumption on her family who have destroyed her self-esteem by telling her the truth.It appears that the two of them will limp along bankrolled by Ethan`s mom, who luckily meets a new man more interesting than her son.Toss in a police chief with narcolepsy and you have a story that makes you want to yell GAK!",0
"I really enjoyed this story for what it's worth. The images are somewhat grotesque, but I'm of a mind to stomach such. It's free people. Just try it if you're into this sort of thing.",1
"I feel the need to start off by saying that I like good erotica.  This wasn't a book that I couldn't put down.  It wasn't one that I rooted either way for the characters to bang all day and in any location.  But, I didn't hate it either.  I think the book was priced appropriately at $1.19, given the length of the story and that it's an e-book.The author tried to make a story line that was different and I appreciate that and applaud her for being creative in that regard.  The sex scenes didn't set me on fire though.  The problem is my mind kept wandering.  I was trying to figure out their ages, how the contest even started, etc.  Perhaps I missed that information when I read the book.I'd say since it's only $1.19, go and buy it because it may be your cup of tea.  It just wasn't mine.I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.",0
"After all of this downloaded to my Kindle, it looks like I will be reading good material for the rest of my life",1

"My Review by Carlyn - BMR Guest ReviewerLark has been in love with her cousin Taran for years. Don't worry they are cousins only by a late marriage so no ick factor! What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes! I look forward to reading more books from this author.5 out of 5 stars.",1
"Typical book by Louis L'Amour one of the best you can read as you read it seems that you are riding the trail along the side of the stories character,  you see what he sees, you hear what he hears . Can't go wrong with this author.",1
"The story had so much potential, and was actually holding my attention...until...What happened? Never introduce people at the end! Especially when they are an important part of the plot. Then you never gave that person any type of background at all? Why not have had her just kill him in the first bloody place? I don't want to give away anything, but seriously? It ended like that? I was left wondering if I accidentally skipped to another book. Yes, the ending is that bad.Did you get bored? I wish you would go back and see this through properly. I wanted to see the relationship between Davey and Cookie be something more. I wanted to see where it would lead. ( In friendship) possibly sparking his memories or persuading him to build new ones.... even if he is dead!You have such potential, in this story and as a writer. Don't hurry endings.",0
Storyline could have been better and it was slow. It took to long to get to the threesome. As long as it it VERY cheap it is somewhat worth it.,0
Not what I expected but really enjoyed this will probably get more of this series.A few hot bits that are great,1
"Megan Warden is an Enforcer for her werewolf Pack.  As such, she is the second most important wolf in her compound.  Megan is traveling to the wedding of a cousin and has been asked to pick up another wolf at the airport; her sister's anchor, Shane Rosario. Megan doesn't think anything of it until she smells him and once that happens nothing can stop the two from mating.Shane Rosario denies the wolf inside of him.  Brought up by his mother to hate what he is, Shane never loses control and never changes.  When Megan Warden picks him up at the airport and Shane senses his inner wolf rumbling, he is shocked but goes with the flow.  One mating later, the two are at odds at their sudden relationship.Shane refuses to give up his medicine and life in Las Vegas.  Megan can't imagine living outside of her pack.  Refusing to give Shane an ultimatum, Megan vows that she won't press him for more than he can give, even though each day without him breaks her heart into tiny pieces.Fated clicked with me instantly.  I felt Megan's tenacity at not wanting to give up her pack but I also felt Shane's shame for being a werewolf.  Lauren Dane has written a highly emotional story in Fated.  Shane and Megan face real fears and have to make agonizing choices.Fated was about communication and working through problems.  The mating of Shane and Megan took them by surprise but they refused to give up on their mating and each other.  Just the way a loving relationship should be.  Mark Fated in the winner's column! I loved it!Natalie S.",1

"I wasn't familiar with author Joe Hill's writing, so I figured this Kindle Single would be a good introduction, and it was. ""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts. [Note: the Amazon book description is for four different stories; only the last description that begins with ""John Finney..."" applies to ""The Black Phone.""]In the story, John Finney has been abducted by a man dubbed by the media as the Galesburg Grabber, a fiend who has already kidnapped and murdered several kids in the area. John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending. To say anything more would be a spoiler.In a surprise twist, the author has hidden a second story, ""Scheherazade's Typewriter,"" in the acknowledgments after ""The Black Phone,"" so you're actually getting two stories with your download. ""Scheherazade's Typewriter"" was a very short but clever story that gave a new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""!",1
"This book was too over the top for my tastes.  After reading 50 Shades of Grey, I am okay with reading TASTEFUL BDSM story lines.  This book contains two men/one woman sex scene that I couldn't personally stomach.  Not for me.  I deleted this from my Kindle app quickly.",0

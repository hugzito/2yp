"Pros: Excellent movement and control. Works great on multiple smooth surfaces. Responsive clicks. Fits both hands. USB receiver dongle is very small and unobtrusive, yet still transmits well. Light weight. Best of all, for me, the wheel clicks as you roll it.Cons: Too small for my tastes at roughly 4.5"" x 2.5"". It really only supports my fingers and part of my palm, which makes it uncomfortable to use for any length of time. The battery compartment is on top of mouse and slides around while I'm using the mouse. Feels cheaply made. Left-mouse button dead on arrival.",0
"a great book for kids who like Alice in Wonderland, The Never Ending Story. a fun read for adults as well.",1
"The Sonata and the 44 Duos are wonderful pieces to be sure, and Pauk's interpretation is good. However, the sound quality on this and every other Naxos recording I have ever heard is bad. Do Bartok the courtesy of listening to a good recording of this fantastic music.",0

"even though tosh.o is not all that original, america's funniest home videos had terrible comic jokes. Tosh improves it and makes it hilarious. this show is absolutely terribly unfunny. it was painful to watch the host and guests come up with jokes that were quite lame. watch tosh, you'll be happier for it....",0
"A nice book. The book is short and a bit ""youngish"" in the pictures and layout. It's encouragement of expression of feeling about moving is so-so. I think it would be most useful with elementary school-aged children. The topic is not covered in depth and I would want more emphasis on learning the culture, language (and the like) about the country to which the child was moving if the child were gifted or older than about 6-7 years.",0
"It's simply an aweful item. I bought it brand new, with no scratches, but the disc behaved like I had scratched it up terribly. It would skip all over. We could never finish a game because it would just return to the main menu after half way through any game. Maybe I just got a faulty disc but if not, the item is terrible.",0
I saw this moive in the theater with a large group of people with varying taste every person thought that it was the worse movie they have ever seen. Guys if you like Al Pacino and thinl he can do no wrong you will still hate this movie trust me. It is terible and what makes it worse is that they try and make it complicted so as to pass as an inteligent movie and hide the lack of a plot and acting that destroys this movie. It also has that generic feel to it you can tell the writers did no research about the topic and instead just tried to count on two big names to carry this terrible move. Nobody with any taste can enjoy this movie.,0
"Nice recording. I particulary like ""Hastings Street Bounce"". It sounds like it has a bit of New Orleans in it. The ELVIN Jones drum solo, as is often the case, sounds out of control--one wonders when he's going to lose the beat entirely. Then, somehow, he comes back on the one and WHAM! it hits you on the nose.",1

"What a bad album this is!I never imagine that any singer of classical music can be that bad. Or maybe Mr Watson simply is not a singer of classical music. He only pretends to be one and then made such a sad showing.Honestly, I think buying this album is just a sheer waste of money, although it has dispelled, for me at least, all those exaggerated myths surrounding this singer.",0

"Contrary to the technical data presented here, this product does NOT ship with ATI's Mobility Radeon 7500C video board. The video board is instead ATI's Radeon IGP 340M, which is based on an old Radeon technology (for a comparison between Mobility Radeon and Mobility Radeon 7500 see the site tomshardware.com). For those interested in playing new 3D games, this is a no-no. Besides that, the system comes with a poor selection of cheap softwares and games, which in the end eat up 7GB of your hard drive. The fan is also particularly loud and annoying. The only + goes to its sleek design.",0
"Ok, let's get one thing down before this review goes any further: this movie is a two-star movie on the basis of its storyline. There are some elements of the film which will give viewers a few surprises, but overall, it is an example of a lack of intelligent filmmaking.However, on the basis of sound design, this movie is one of the best films ever. From the very beginning of the film, the soundtrack exhibits excellent qualities when it comes to utilizing the .1 LFE, from the vintage footage of H-bomb testing to the giant lizard thundering through the streets of New York City. Almost every scene, whether it has to do with the musical score or the sound effects of the scene, the surround sound is fully enveloping. There is no other way to describe this DVD: the sound design alone makes it a must for anyone into sound effects design.",0
"Who can stand to listen to this woman? Impressive set of pipes? Of course. But utterly lacking in soul, distinctiveness, personal phrasing, anything beyond the hey-listen-to-me bluster of so many young singers lately (Aguilera and Celine Dion also have good voices, but two minutes of either and I'm fast asleep). Let's face it; if there were no such thing as music videos, and CD covers were blank, and she never made any personal appearances (and thus, in other words, she had to trade off only on her voice and not her hooker's wardrobe), the public would be long gone.",0
The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing. This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people). At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink. I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer. Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper. Also the blade takes a while to clean.,0
"This book swept me along as if I were riding on a fire truck. The excitement never waned, and the details about fire equipment and fire fighting were intelligently explained to this layman. I look forward to the next Georgia Skeehan book. Mac sounds like a really promising romantic interest; I hope he appears in the next book.",1
You can't go wrong with Bicycle playing cards. I owned these cards previously and finally had to throw them out after nearly 10 nears of moderate use. I've used these once so far and I can already tell they are the same high quality and I expect them to last for years!,1
"Old school coffee pot that fast and keeps coffee hot as long as you want. Bought this for my wife you she loves it. Well made and works perfectly. If you want to make great coffee that old school way, this is your pot!",1
"I'm dissapointed in the watch mostly because I find it difficlut to read it. There isn't enough contrast between the hands and the face of the watch. The digital readout is all but useless as you have to use the back light in order to read it. I also find the profile a little too high (i.e., it's too thick) for my taste.",0
"You just have to try it to believe it. I used it on my stainless steel built-in refrigerator, micrwave, oven and dishwasher. They all look new now and the good thing they stay stainless for a while. Make sure you shake it before you apply it. I used a cloth instead of paper towel. I would recommend it. Give it a try.",1
"I loved this book! Even though I cried through much of it, it served a useful purpose. After never wanting to have children, I had a revelation that I needed to experience the joys of motherhood. I recently had a miscarriage with my first and much wanted pregnancy. I was a mess. This book helped me get over some of the loss I felt. I still feel sad often but realize that I'm not supposed to ""Just get over it, already!"" The book was honest, sad, hopeful, real, and made me totally feel like I was not alone in my grief. I am hopeful and anxious to finish this book by reading the chapters about trying again, coping with a subsequent pregnancy and birth, and the other chapters I know one day I will read when I feel ready to embark on the scary but exciting journey of pregnancy. I also feel compelled to share this with anyone who has gone through the death of a child. Thank you Deborah Davis, Ph.D. for the gift of this book!",1
I bought these as a gift for my wife on Valentine's day. We don't usually exchange gifts for V-day but I thought I would give her a nice token gift. The quality seems better than the price paid. They are a little smaller than I thought but once she put them on they looked fine. You usually get what you pay for but I think the quality of the earings are worth more than what Amazon is asking for. I would recomend as a token type gift but don't give them for a birthday or Anniversary guys.,1
"This product works well to keep your delicate skin around the eyes somewhat hydrated. Did nothing for any wrinkles. I would not pay full price for this product, but if you can find it on sale, its worth it.",1
We had one of these - the interior is lined with some fabric which collects dust and bugs. When I bought another Patio Caddie I opted to also get The Char-Broil 4714 Heavy Duty Water Smoker Cover which fits The Caddie just fine and is only $10. It has an elastic band which you may or may not like - I snipped mine and it now falls easily with no annoying fabric lining to boot!,0
"If you're looking for inexpensive binoculars, don't complain when they don't work like a $300 pair of binoculars. I got these for the sole purpose of my kids having some to play with when we go camping. For the price, they're GREAT!!! They actually see very well. Even my husband and I use them. I would strongly recommend these to anyone looking for some cheap binoculars.",1

"Mary Higgins Clark's latest mystery/thriller ""Before I Say Goodbye"" is another exciting and suspenseful book that kept me wondering until the very end.Nell McDermott is a lonely young woman with a difficult past. Her husband is mysteriously killed accidentally in a boating explosion right after they had a big fight concerning Nell running for a congressional office once held by her Grandfather. Consumed with guilt and regret, Nell taps in to psychic powers and strength she didn't know she had and contacts friends who seem to be trying to help her. She realizes there it may not have been an accident but a murder. But who is the murderer and who was the targeted victim? The characters are well written and believable.",1

"I am not good in history or geography. When I read THE AMERICAN PROPHECIES I began to understand how our wastefulness in the US has and will continue to fund the terrorists who attack our homeland and kill our troops.

"I ordered this set expecting a mild soap that could be used on face and body. I wasn't expecting the very strongly scented soap, akin to Irish Spring or other bar soaps. I certainly wasn't going to use this on my face. So I put the bottles in the shower. My husband seems to like it, and the soap does seem to have a smooth texture and lathers nicely. But the bathroom smells of this for a long time afterwards. It's a clean smell, I suppose, but very strong.",0
I had seen this movie several times on the sci-fi channel at home. I always enjoyed watching it and found the characters so interesting and so alive. I wanted to own it and I actually had a hard time finding it out in the real world. Amazon seems to be about the only place that has it. Matter of fact some store employees would look at me weird and have no idea what I was talking about. It will be a classic one day!,1
"Just want to add this to the review posted by ""a music fan"", who is asking who the sax player was on these classic US Bonds tracks. The sax player was Gene Barge, a/k/a ""Daddy G"". That's why Bonds shouts ""Blow Daddy!"" on so many of these recordings, and why the lyrics to ""Quarter to Three"" include the line ""dance with Daddy G"". Daddy G was the leader of the Chuch Street Five, the house band for Legrand Records, who backed up US Bonds, as well as Jimmy Soul (eg, ""If You Wanna Be Happy""). They also recorded many hot instrumentals on their own, which bascially sound like US Bonds records with the vocals removed. Gene Barge went on to work for Chess Records in Chicago, and can be heard on many recordings, such as ""Rescue Me"" by Fontella Bass. There...now you know!",1
"I listened to Modest Mouse when ""Building something out of nothing"" came out. that was a pretty good album. some nice tracks. I then moved to ""This is a long drive..."" not but a few weeks later, and this was even better. I loved them. The last Cd of theirs i got was Moon and Antartica. Let me say, this is my favorite album ever. Moon and antartica is better than pink floyd, radiohead, anything else. it was a masterpiece. I heard theyd had a new album coming out, so i looed into it. I was taken aback when hearing them on the radio. Not too much later, i was soon feeling weary. Modest Mouse made its way to TRL. not only did their new cd suck, but their single they promoted sucked too. Please, anyone from thirteen year old girls, to 90 year old men, buy mon and antartica or this is a long drive! This cd was mch too mainstream. to me, modest mouse had meant inie rock at itsbest. you guys dissapoint me. these tracks are catchy and crap. Moon and antartica! ok, thank you all.",0
Great delivery service and terrific price! This arrived right before Christmas as gift for my husband. We both are enjoying the coffee maker. We can pick our own coffee choices. It works great. We both love it!!!,1
"This book is unbelivable. Lizzy and Darcy's oldest son is like another Wickam. Which would never happen if Jane A had written the book .This is the second book of Emma Tennant's that I have read the first being Pemberly, and I am not impressed in the least. She is a disgrace to the proffesion of being a author. She should be publically disgraced.",0
"The author includes a wide variety of jewelry making techniques primarily dealing with metalsmithing. Full color pictures wonderfully illustrate each section. Simple wire projects, such as making jump rings to more advanced techniques such as inlaying are shown and described with enough detail to understand, but not overwhelm the reader. I'd recommend this book for the beginner who wants to learn about jewelry making, or for those who just want to learn more about jewelry making. Also included is a Themes section of artistic jewelry that will inspire you.",1
"The iPod Classic 80Gb is probably the best product regarding MP3 players Apple currently has. It is stable and it has proved to be a good device. Although iTunes is not good enought (slow, heavy and buggy) the device itself is pretty good. Just remember...DON'T DROP IT !!!!",1
"Big fan of Jack Higgins, was pleased to add this book to my collection. Arrived within the given time and was packaged well. Pricing was very fair. Good buy.",1
"I discovered this jewel on AMAZON.COM when they flashed it up via database association when I was researching espresso makers. [thanks Ma Amazon, I just LOVE the fact that you are always reading my mind ;^]Anyway, we have started using the 6 cup Bialetti Moka Express [Italian cups that is, which is a 1 cup American, ha-ha!] with the wonderful Lavazza Espresso grind coffee, [yes Virginia, Amazon has it] and what a wonderful thing that combo is. [But seriously now, the ""yield"", using an espresso grind, is about 8-9 oz.]Can't say whether the knockoffs work as well as the original; as for myself I have always had a policy of rewarding excellence in my purchases so paying the little premium for the real thing, by the people who originated it, is a no-brainer.BTW, we bought a friend the combo pak with the Bialetti milk frother and she says that the frother is just as exemplary as the coffeepot! Amazon has the combo.",1
Very good and action packed. Solomon kicks butt. Worth every penny on the still in theaters rental. Go watch it now!,1
"This dress is truly beautiful and the material is definitely of high quality...but the measurements suck. It was awkwardly long, going almost to my ankles when it's supposed to be around my knees....I'm an average 5'5"" so that seemed unusual. The hips were made big while the waist was tiny. The boobs were also quite large. I commend the women that are this shape, but it's not me! Buying this dress really put me in a bind since I had to return it. Beware of the measurments!!",0
"Consider my rating 3 1/2 stars.Maybe they got a little to latched onto this style. This is often a problem with bands whose style is very unique. While the first disc pops with originality, the inability to really push beyond that style in subsequent releases will cause many fans to move on and be happy with the first release. Often the only way for bands with such a unique style, like Portishead, to have long term success is to have long periods between releases so that a new generation discovers their sound and sounds fresh to old fans. If you have the first Portishead you can probably skip this one or download a few of your favorites.",1
"""A Hard Chance"" was a great read. It put me there, aboard the boats that took a terrific pounding in Bass Strait during the Sydney to Hobart ocean race. If you enjoyed Sebasatian Junger's ""The Perfect Storm,"" you'll love Kim Leighton's ""A Hard Chance.""",1
At first I did not believe this movie was funny till I started (Laughing) reading the reviews (Laughing) I wish I had a dollar for every time some one said this is not a anti-Christian movie (laughing) I would be the richest man in the world (still Laughing),0
"For a quick record of your activities, weight, moods, morning HR......etc this is the shiznit. I have had em all and this is the one I keep filling out. The training information at the front of the book is very helpful too. The spiral binding allows me to keep the book on my desk and open to my training week.....staring me in the face, reminding me to train and fill the little pages out. I like it.",1
Out of the box. No damage. No missing components.Setup was eazy.Strightened up the tip on a few screw drivers.Verible speed is a nice option.So far very please.,1
"I really should have read more reviews before buying this, just like a lot of other people have said the left channel slowly went bad, didn't really notice it on older records but on ones where it certain sounds are separated between the left and right channels it became very obvious. After that it just slowly started to die altogether, trust me spend the extra cash and get something nicer it will be worth it in the end.Also don't come with a place for the ground wire, ended up having to connect it to one of the main screws.",0
"A book of rejection letters seems like a novel idea, until you realize that it seems like you've read it before, and it was funnier the first time. ""Dear Earnest and Julio"" is certainly well meaning enough, but it fails to establish as eccentric of a main chacater as comedian Don Novello did in his classic books with a similar take on corporate America : ""The Lazlo Letters : The Amazing, Real-Life, Actual Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American"" AND ""Citizen Lazlo! : The Continuing, Unrelenting Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American! Vol 2."" Novello got there first, and in no knock against Fred Grimes and David Freed, did it better the first time",0
"This is a classic 80's horror soundtrack, which utilizes the Roland Juno/Jupiter 6 to great extent. Some of the tracks were also used in the 80's horror film ""Monster Dog.""",1
"I think this story itself had a lot of potential. Michael Biehn played an exellent role in becoming a pschotic killer hunting after his obsession. Alexandra Vandernoot filled the role completely as the lovely,courageous woman living in the wilderness in the unknown territories of reservation land...Iowaka however played a good supporting role, what happened to her real voice? The screen setting was excellent and literally brought you back to the wooded days when travelling was done by dog-sled & snow shoes...those were the days!",1
This book is the first I have ever seen of hers. And I found it to be as I like to call it a grabber. I most liked the twist with the Step mother. I think this is open for another book. Can't wait to see what she puts out next. Hope its just as good or even better.,1
"Ezzo appears to have climbed into the mind of God, and now pretends to speak for him. ""...God's divine intention for parents to use physical pain to correct a child's rebellious activities."" God's son would be the first to object, as even a cursory reading of the New Testament would tell us. Ezzo tells us to hit the child ""to free him of his guilt of sin"". Those who completed Psych 101 recognize this as projection. Ezzo is a man in deep psychiatric trouble, and before he does more harm to children ought to be taken into custody for psychiatric counseling.- Norm Lee, author of Parenting Without Punishing",0
"Masterful songs flow throughout this beautiful, emotional(but-don't-call-it-emo!)disc, scaling the heights of Kinsella and co's excellent, under-rated and influential discography at the crossroads between his hypnotic and mathematical best. There are moments when the compelling structures falter a bit under their ambitions, but by far, to me, it is the wonderful synthesis of everything his earlier bands did in the way of tight percussion and everything his later work did for melodic depth in repetition in one very heartfelt and convincing package, from one musical loving band to one musical loving ear- not to be missed for fans of the emotionally intricate.",1
I really like Shannon Tweed. I think she's beautiful. You can see her working out in a very sexy outfit. If you like Shannon Tweed you would like to see it. The plot of the movie is entertaining but the end of the movie *****.,0
"I purchased these after trying on my son's speedo flip-flops. His were incredibly comfortable but, unfortunately, didn't come in my size. These are ALMOST as comfortable. Great to wear to the beach or to work in the yard.",1
"It always seemed to me that the task of novel writing included a cohesive development of a long story. However, in this particular case, a very talented and intelligent author delivered a pastiche of fragments of varied length and often rather questionable quality. I found the reading process extremely exhausting. If you are looking for a well-paced and intelligently written narrative don't read this book. It gets a little better around page 140 when you are just about ready to give up. However, it doesn't lead anywhere. I am a very tolerant reader (some fragments of the books are actually even interesting and the writing itself actually consistently intelligent, alhtough often too dense) but as a novel this book is a complete disaster. It should be called ""G. An Awkwardly Disjointed Pastiche About a Sex Addict and Politics"". Not a novel.",0
"My husband and I didn't like this very much. I had seen it years and years ago and remembered it as being funny. It wasn't really, it's too outdated.",0
"I purchased this watch for my son for Christmas. The wrist band was too large, and unlike his prior Fossil watch, very difficult to adjust. He ended up having to pay $15 to a jeweler to adjust it. Shortly afterwards one of the hour or minute markers fell off.",0
"I happened on Everett Greene via the Marvin Chandler/Jack Gilfoy Christmas album called ""When a Child Is Born,"" which gets my vote for one of THE great Chrstmas albums: soul, jazz, and a true devotionality. These guys (Chandler is the pianist on the ""Iv'e Got Love"" album too) are completely for real--the best in jazz, nothing gimicky or overplayed, just right there in the center of the heart and soul. These are the real musicians that seem to be there in plenty around the world yet rarely get the praise they deserve in our hyped-up system of recognition. I'm so glad an album like this got recorded. On this album ""A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square"" will send chills down your spine, and that's not the only one either, but when I sampled that online I knew I had to download this album!",1
This is one of the best photo books I have seen. It also has nice writing that emphasizes the various styles of Carson. It was also nice to spot some of the images used on The Fragile within.,1
This is one epic book like other novels Danielle Steel has penned yet another masterpiece. The trials and tribulations Zoya has to go through is truly awe inspiring. From the russian revolution through the depression and world wars 1 & 2. Danielle Steel has woven facts of history through another tale of fiction.This is yet another masterpiece.,1
"I regret purchasing this album, because the music's pace is far too fast to be enjoyable. Satie is meant to be enjoyed in the background and at a leisurely pace. Listening to the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes being sped up the way are is a travesty, it puts too much focus on PAYING ATTENTION to the music, instead of having it create an ambience as such music is intended to. Maybe she should have paid attention to the orchestrations of the Gymnopedies at the end and focused on that tempo.",0
"For mainly touring London and a few other cities nearby, this is a great resource to have! I was most impressed with the commentary on the British Museum as it gave more insight than some of the placards. Most locations have hours and days that are closed, but the House of Parliment did not and it was closed for Easter Holiday (during the week preceeding Easter) which would have been nice to know ahead of time. Since Rick changes this every year, it would also be nice to know the prices for certain bus tickets and such.I still believe this was the best tour guide I could have used, even with room for improvement :-)",1
"This book exposes a lifestyle of greed, fraud, deceit, and sexual perversion in Greenwich, Connecticut, a refined town where you don't expect such unspeakable things to happen. The author takes you through a bizzarre sequence of events from Frankel's hometown in Toledo all the way to the Vatican! This book uncovers it all -- embezzlement, betrayal, adultery, suicide, sadomasochistic sex, corruption, and a climactic FBI international chase in the pursuit of the most wanted white collar criminal in the country.",1
"This is one of the first Thai cookbooks I purchased. Since then I have purchased several others, but I keep coming back to this one as my starting point for creating an Asian menu. As most other reviewers have stated, the directions are clear and the ingredient list is manageable. Young offers some helpful tips along the way to make it easier.Some of the humor sprinkled throughout the book is an unexpected surprise. I love the spicy chili sauce recipe where the last step is ""call the fire department"".If I had one quibble with this book, it would be that more photographs of the completed recipes would be helpful. Even so it is not a major issue.All in all a good investment if you want to learn how to cook Thai food. And if you are like me, living in an area that is devoid of neighborhood Thai restaurants, it is a necessity for those of us who need our Thai ""fix"" on a regular basis.",1
I saw this movie on Netflix and really liked it .Unfortunately it could not be purchased at Netflix or iTunes.Amazingly amazon had this dvd at a good price and it was packaged with extra scenes and printed material and a case.,1

I wasted big money on this book.

"OK. I really enjoyed the first two Odd Thomas books, but this one's just not as good. Odd leave his hometown for a Catholic retreat, and bumps his way around a snowbound weird murder mystery. There's an bony monster sprung from unconvincing quantum theory that slumps around a not too exciting plot. Odd is still a very likable hero and there's some nifty and memorable one liners. Koontz does have a nice turn of phrase here and again, but the lack of excitement in this thriller... lead to my 2 star rating.",0
Like some of the previous reviewers wrote. Half of the holes did not line up to bolt together. On top of that it was missing the second set of arms. I called and they sent it right out but just something else that didn't work right.,0
"Like another reviewer, I am disappointed that as of 2010, the wrappers no longer float up into the air when lit. In fact, I've written this review only because we had gotten some for a 60th birthday dinner party we hosted and were curious why they didn't work.The cookies themselves are light in texture, flavorful (very...H-bomb department), and crunchy. But they are so sweet your molars will explode on contact.To many people these are good things. But since I do not like extreme sweetness, I'm not one of them. Too bad, because the texture is very nice. Anyway, you folks who are averse to sugary stuff should stick to your favorite biscotti.We would serve these cookies on the side with the ""main"" dessert, exclusively on special occasions when we wanted to do the delightful little trick with the wrappers. Without that ability, we have no reason to buy the cookies.",0

"I am by no means a professional cake decorator but with five children I have decorated many a cake. I really liked this product as it is easy to use and easy to clean etc. and I am not a fan of a pastry bag. The problem is- the button you push down on to dispense the frosting breaks! I thought it was a fluke thing, but then bought another one and the same exact thing happened! Very disappointed and I won't bother purchasing another... as I'm sure the end result would be the same. Too bad!",0
This is a cute book with some really great massage tips and ideas. It has definitely improved my technique :),1
I own a Colorado canoe. Its very comfortable but very frustrating to paddle. It doesn't track well at all. It works okay with tandem paddlers but is very difficult with a solo kayak paddle and impossible with a canoe paddle. I can turn a perfect circle but can't go straight. The boat goes 2 feet left or right for every foot forward on the opposite side of your stroke. Those were the best results I acheived. My wife and I together can go relatively straight but its still quite a chore. Perhaps a skeg will help but the boat isn't designed for a skeg (according to Sevylor's Customer Service department) so I'd look at different boats or plan to buy the trolling motor (which is side mounted),0
"I first discovered this book one summer when I was a teenager in among my mothers stash of old books upstairs. It was old and falling apart, the copyright was 1921. But I fell in love with it! It is passionate and romantic in a way books are not written anymore. This book inspired me to start writing on my own. About every year I start wanting to read it again and since is it so old and the pages no longer stick to the binding it is time for me to get a new one. This book is for everyone who loves passionate, old fashioned romances. Boy sees girl, boy kidnaps girl and forces her to be his love slave.......",1

"It's hard to tell from the white on white picture here, but the bottom flap snaps in a weird way-- the snaps are very high up. They also seem to run very small (or they shrink in the wash). My baby is 3 months old and at his most recent check-up was only in the 25th percentile for height; I bought the 9-month size thinking I would get a few larger items to be prepared ahead of time and they are too short! He is chubby (about 14 pounds) and generally wear 3-6 month items, but this is a little ridiculous.",0

"I got this toy when my daughter was 6 months and since then she couldn't be less interested, she is currently 11 months and hasn't played with it once, i wish I wouldn't have wasted my money1.

"There's nothing new or powerful about this turd. This album is generic nu-metal crap. Dime-a-dozen vocals, recycled guitar riffs...you get the point. Good musicians, but it just doesn't sound inspired.It's about as heavy as Disturbed, so if that's your kind of metal, then enjoy. Boring!",0
"I purchased this CD to replace an identical one which I literally wore out, so obviously I'm satisfied with the quality of the performance and the selections included.

I saw online that FRONTLINE was the best product to kill fleas so I decided to buy it, even though it is extremely expensive for the small bottles it has. I put it on my dog, and after 3 days the fleas were back. This product is not worth it at all, it is a waste of money!",0
"Being a fan of Diane Lane, usually I watch her films. This one promised to be a generallly entertaining thriller, the more so if you add the presence of ((each day uglier) Mickey Rourke and Thomas Jane, an actor I think deserved better fortunes (by that I mean better roles) in the movie business.But guess what? I was wrong. This is not a good movie. It's technically efficient, I guess. But it's so full of plot holes, lack of interesting characters, lazy acting... well, the list goes on and on. The actor who plays Rourke's side kick gives such an over the top performance that seldom I've seen such annoying performance.Anyway, since the movie is relatively short (95 minutes), you probably have a chance of not getting too mad after watching it...",0

"Ms. Kostas provides a great introduction wherein she discusses the basics of sound nutrition. Then it is on to the recipes. Although I haven't counted, there appear to be about 200 individual recipes which fall into 11 separate catagories. Literally there are multiple recipes for every occassion.This is not a program of deprivation. We have been sampling Ms. Kostas's recommendations for the past six weeks. They have been outstanding without exception. In my case, it has also helped me to shed the extra pounds. I highly recommend the book to anyone that wants to eat well, but healthy.",1

"I have a Belkin and a Monster surge protector and this APC completely shadowed both of them in terms of features. Monster costs less, so I expected that. However, my expensive Belkin purchase is now put to shame that this one arrived. I didn't expect much since the brand isn't popular, but here's what it has that others don't have (w/out paying twice the price anyways):- 7 outlets- end outlet has extra room, so you actually have room to use one of those heavy plugs- outlet for a phone cord (I don't get this one yet, but maybe someone else will find it useful.)- on/off switch to open/cut power- protector caps for unused plugs (already child-proofed!)If you don't want to spend a lot, but you want the features of more expensive surge protectors, then this is a great buy!",1

"Not going to waste time rereviewing the movie since others have done a much better job of it then I have. What I will say is that Fox has given us a bum deal with a single disk version lacking all of the good bonus features found on the Indian version.

"Super Blue was one of the solid songs played by the D.J.'s at W,O.L. radio in Wasington, D.C.. At around noon the format would change from the popular tunes of the time to an album oriented groove that shocked the system (if you were young) or cleansed the soul (if you were grown-up). Lunch time for government workers was a time to shake the hum-drum and gain and grain a sence of ""SELF"" for an hour or more. This album was a contributing factor toward that end.It was hip enough yet constrained for anyone who appreciated/enjoyed good music without freting about chord structure or improvisational..blah-blagh blagh. Freddie and company were after the dollars made by the new fans that Miles Davis had created, but in a different way. All in all, there was good music to be enjoyed by all. Thanks guys at (WWWWOOOOLLLLL) for this and other great programing back in the 70's.",1
"Inspiring, and very well written. Deeply moving account of a woman who has been through hell and yet kept her dignity, her sanity, and her inner strength. Out of her nightmare, she found the courage to help others and build a beautiful new life. A shining example for all who have suffered, or are helping others cope with the legacy of violence.",1
"I agree with MrPacDan. This guy SOUNDS very much like all the retro vocalists going around today. Maybe other reviewers have heard more by this band to prove otherwise, but based solely on this single, they are a total killers/bravery knockoff. That would be fine because those bands are awesome, but the song isn't nearly as easy to swallow as those pop/dance masterpieces. If you're into that kind of music and looking for something new, I'd suggest you check out the singles by a band called Protocol.",0

"This is a great album, released in 1977 and there are some real winners on this CD. ""Home"" my all time favorite Bonnie Raitt; LOVE that song, have from day one. ""About To Make Me Leave Home,"" ""Louise"" and ""Three Time Loser"" are stand-outs in my mind. I love her version of ""Runaway,"" so gutsy and raunchy. I do not like EVERY song, so normally it would get 4 stars but the ones I do like are super standouts, thus the 5 stars!I think this album got lost by her being over-shadowed by Ronstadt who was putting out some great albums at the same time.",1
"I bought 4 DVDs in this series, because I had heard the name ""Stott"" often in relation to Pilates. I was looking forward to solid instruction and moderately challenging exercises. To say I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement. I have had a difficult time getting through these workouts even once each, not because they are difficult, but because they are so incredibly slow paced and boring. Stott talks in a monotone throughout, and it took great effort to stay focused on the workout. Very, very boring! I would definitely not recommend these workouts unless you like following an instructor who is just barely above comatose energy.",0
"The very first romance book I ever read was by Penny Jordan and I've loved the genre ever since. I've always enjoyed her stories especially but when I read this I couldn't believe she wrote it. The heroine is a horrible wimp and I have yet to meet a woman like her in the 21st century. She was so annoying that I found this story impossible to enjoy, if I could give this book zero stars than I would.The Sandra Marton story was enjoyable and the only redeeming thing about purchasing this book. Her characters were easy to like and the heroine in the story was strong and independent. I hate when the women are all wimpy and clingy to the men like they couldn't possibly survive without a man.",0
"In a very easy read, each chapter reviews a different crazy Christian teaching such as ""I just need to give it to the Lord..."". It explains how each of our our crazy Christian thinking ways keep us stuck in our problems. The most awesome parts are the very clear explanations of how to address the issues in life that we try to apply these crazy ways to.If you feel many suggested ""Christian"" ways to solve problems aren't working, this book is a must. Dr. Cloud is a very sincere Christian who is also incredibly wise in how God made people. His ways for addressing problems are simple, biblically based, and make sense. Best of all, they work!",1
"Since there is no such thing as ""Satan,"" the very title of this book ""threw me off"" when browsing the book store, but since it was in the ""bargan bin,"" I felt it was wortyh two dollars to read. Now that I've read it, I want my two dollars back--- it was not worth it.It is well and good to relate anecdotal information if it is then supported by good data; the author does not bother doing this. It is also okay to add emotionalism to retain the reader's interest =IF= it is then followed with reasoned, sensible facts and information--- which the author also has not done.All in all, a waste of time. Please consider reading a different book.",0

"This is a decent enough collection of the Chambers Brothers best but there are two songs which had great extended album versions: ""Time Has Come Today'"" and ""New Generation."" The original album which includes ""Time Has Come Today"" is still in print and can be ordered in cd form. Unfortunately, the ""New Generation"" album is not in print. Therefore, the ""long"" version of that song is hard to get. I loved the Chambers Brothers and I used to buy their albums in vinyl when I was in high school. I also used to see them perform live. I would play the great long versions over and over. Here, the collection is great but the versions included are disappointing. The cd still gets 4 stars for great performances by a great band.",1
"I had to put this book down after only 75 pages, because of the use of the non-word ""disorientating"" 4 times in 6 pages. Where the heck was the editor???

The book was very helpful by telling me what I should and shouldn't do with a new kitten. The book gave alot of information about how to care for the cat thoughtout her whole life, not just another kitten book. I will not be selling it because I think I will be looking for it though out the years. It also had diffirent chapters explain what to do about breeding, grooming, and other things I needed to know.

"I love the ships and their drumming-droning sound in this movie and that's about all I love with this piece of schlock. Gene Barry is so wooden and Ann Robinson wrecks my last nerve with her incessant shrieking and push-button hysterics. Read H.G. Wells's classic book (the one with Edward Gorey's illustrations is the bomb!), listen to Orson Welles's classic broadcast, see Steven Spielberg's acclaimed new effort, or even watch re-runs of the okay TV series (which, by the way, used the ship design and sounds I love so much), but DON'T bother with this tired, stereotypically '50's rendition, unless you're in the mood for some yucks over its campiness.

When I bought it, eager to read and trace back the mythological families, I was rather disappointed. Of course, there are many different versions of each stories, but some of these ""differences"" are rather inaccurate. (ex: Here is a quote from the book ""Hippolytus was appalled by her passion, he preffered to hunt at night with the virgin goddess Artemis) Now, I know the myths have many versions, but Hippolytus was a priest, according to Euripides, play, Hippolytus. Besides, Artemis' hunting companions were mainly nymphs, anyway. There were many ""differences"" such as this in the book. I would not recommend it.",0

"I have used these bath tablets with both my two granddaughters and my two nephews. I started when they were aged 2 and 6. They'd choose one color and we'd stand beside the tub and watch them fizz and melt. At first they used one color, then I asked them what would happen if they put a second color in there. Then we had green, orange, or purple. When they put in all three colors, we had an ugly gray. In this way, I taught them colors on the color wheel. A year later, my 3 year old was painting a canvas for my living room. She was using the red paint and I told her she needed more purple (I meant somewhere on the canvas). She promptly picked up some blue paint and painted a line over the red paint she had just used. AT AGE 3. So, These tablets are fun and educational! All four kids know the colors on the color wheel now.And they still have fun using colored bathwater....My oldest is now 10.",1

"I saw a special on Mario Bava and it featured many of his horror films. They looked very interesting and interviwers said tha many of Bava's ideas were later copied by American filmakers. With that said ""Lisa and the Devil"" filmed in '76 is a mess of a movie. It makes no sense, and sometimes that's fun in a horror flick, but in this movie it's annoying and quite dull. I realize I saw this movie on cable but what happened to the exorcism scene that I saw in the special on Bava. Not that it would have made the movie any more intelligable, but at least a bit more interesting. Overall not a good movie.",0

There simply is not a scene where he isn't praying, reminding everyone that god is to be served or just generally mewling about his creator.Whatever your view of religion, be it positive or negative, I can't imagine ANYONE could stomach this endless barrage of sickening idolatry. It's like watching a Beatles or Elvis fan prattle on about their favorite singer.Ignoring that, the film is still loaded with re-hashed horror and King stereotypes: creepy little girl, check, ex-alchoholic hero writer, check, drunk old know it all townie, check, corrupt person in power, check... the list goes on and on.It had some good points but I just can't reccommend the thing at all.",0

"The ""poet laureate"" of rock 'n roll. Pity he was so successful and revered. He set the precedent that doomed rock 'n roll to always being a semantic eunuch. Bob Dylan and the Beatles: overrated technicians, forever evading meaning, and never embracing it. ""Savage, meaningless sarcasm"", as I read in Spy Magazine once. I guess if he had spoken his mind more directly, that would have hurt sales too much, right Bob? ""Gotta be good looking, 'cause you're so hard to see"".",0
"John Kay is one of those writers with the rare knack for making economics understandable, and his skills are in full display in this book. Kay offers a sophisticated critique of the assumption that markets can, on their own, guarantee prosperity, and he shows how culture and institutions play a crucial role in driving economic growth. At the same time, he rejects facile attacks on capitalism, arguing convincingly that markets remain the most powerful engine of prosperity ever invented.Kay's style is generally quite readable, but at times here -- more so than in his FT work -- he gets bogged down in theory and detail, and there are ponderous passages to wade through. On the whole, though, this is illuminating stuff, and anyone interested in understanding why some parts of the world are rich while others are poor should take a look.",1
"Being from the Pacific Northwest I follow the Seattle scene rather closely, and I always wonder why the rest of the country seems to pick up on the absolute worst bands to come out of that city. Harvey Danger is repetitive, annoying, and unimaginative. Not to mention WAY overhyped. If you want to be cool because you listen to Seattle music, then go up to that little search box in the corner and type in ""Goodness"" One listen to them and you'll see everything Harvey Danger did wrong. I am on an e-mail discussion group for Goodness, and there's more than one person on there who saw Harvey Danger back when they were periodically getting laughed off the stage. That was only a few years ago. It should still be happening now.",0
"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, R.V. Dietrich's Stones: The Collection, Identification, And Uses continues to be a superb introductory guide for collectors with invaluable advice on where to find stones as well as information on how they are formed, how they can be used, why they vary in color, some are smooth while others rough, some nearly round and others all sorts of shapes. Specifically designed for easy reference, this pocket sized paperback is ideal for knapsack or jacket and offers handy identification tables for commonly found minerals and rocks. The informative text is enhanced with line drawing, an extensive glossary, and lists of suggested readings for further study. Stones is a wonderfully accessible primer, ideal for the non-specialist general reader with an interest in collecting and identifying rocks and minerals while camping or collecting.",1
Been waiting for this movie for years and it is about time it came out. One of my favorite to watch at Christmas.,1
"Author Michael Laimo evokes a heartfelt empathy for his characters and draws the reader into their situations right from the very start. DEEP IN THE DARKNESS tells the tale of a doctor and his family who move from Manhattan to Ashborough, NH, a remote, rural town where secrets harbor an unusual and ugly truth from which there is little hope of escape. A wild ride, this novel is a fear-frothed trip through one man's mind as he struggles to protect his family from a deep-rooted evil. Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down! Very highly recommended!",1
"Twilight is one of the best books I have ever read. Stephenie Meyer knew what she was doing when she wrote this book. I've read it 7 times now. I never get tired of Bella and Edward's story. At first I thought Twilight was done, but when I found out there was going to be a second, and a third, and maybe even more, I flipped. I give Twilight a 10 star rating... That is how much I enjoyed it, and I can't wait for the second.",1
"This book has an appealing title and author. It does not deliver content. The co-author Howard Cutler stumbles through endless interpretation of the Lama's ideas. It seems as if Cutler is trying to filter eastern philosophy through a western filter while oversimplifying for the reader. It is unclear if Cutler is ""dumbing down"" his analysis for the simple-minded reader or possibly just is not good at writing. The book would be far better without his aggravating interjections.""Ethics for a New Millenium"" is a much better choice if your looking for a book by the Dalai Lama.",0

"Tool's 5th release is an amazing addition to the rest. Songs like ""The Grudge"", ""The Patient"", and ""Parabola"" really get your blood flowing. Not only is this album amazing, but it is SMART.

I KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL KINDLES-I HAVE SEARCHED THIS UP AND FOUND ALOT OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS (IE LINES THROUGH ETC.) THEY SEND IT BACK AND IT GETS FIXED.

"The Bottom Line:A terrible low-budget ""remake"" that has almost nothing in common with George A. Romero's 1985 classic aside from one or two character names and a zombie/military theme, this version of Day of the Dead has absolutely nothing to recommend it aside from the short running time, which ensures your misery will at least be brief.",0
"This is a grat book for all of those who are seeking for answers about how evil came to be and why God has let it endure through the ages. This book is not intended for a mind that is too sketptical about religious matters. The person who reads this book should read it with and open mind, and be ready not to embrace what is been said, but to think about it, question it, and embrace it or reject it if he/she feels like doing so. Factual or fiction, it is up to reader to decide it. For me, it has helped me spiritually. If someone would like another great book from Taylor Caldwell I would recomend ""I, Judas"" and ""The Romance of Atlantis."" You wont regret it, these titles will be in you private library forever.",1
"I've been waiting for this DVD for almost two months and I couldn't have been more dissapointed. The mix on the Geddy Lee's mic is awful.

The sound engineers have slain one of the greatest bands of our time.",0
"This shampoo is listed in Amazon's ""Cat"" category and the bottle label indicates it's for dogs and cats. Thank God I talked to my veterinarian before I used this. He said PERMETHRIN is highly toxic to cats! Can cause weakness, vomiting, muscle tremors, seizures and death! I Googled PERMETHRIN and discovered it's toxicity to cats is well known. I've read several reviews on Amazon for cat flea products where the owner reported that their cat became ill or died after using the product. Most of the products contained PERMETHRIN. The Natural Resources Defense Council's website has ratings of many flea products based on their toxcity. You'll find other flea products for cats which are much safer.[ ... ]",0

"Sorry folks. The guy is dead I know. I read all the reviews thinking this was going to be one to add to the CD collection.. and I was truly disappointed. I appreciate great ballads, screaming,wailing, depths of despair stuff.. but, this guy's voice did nothing for me....It was irritating in fact.The tracks.. one after another are moaning, groaning, wailing, monotone, relentlessly boring and morose.Sorry but this was a waste of money built on a great amount of hype, and rather than feel a grand catharsis after listening to it, I almost opened a vein myself.",0
Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!,1
"I have to say this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When we finally figured out what seemed to be the plot of the first half, we were again befuddled as the second half of the movie appeared to have nothing to do with the first half. Characters found out things, had epiphanies, seemed surprised and all, but it was difficult to tell why they were surprised, all they did was see a beat up car! The acting was particularly shoddy, but it was well done compared with the choppy editing, confusingly split screens, and lack of cohesive plot or convincing conclusion. Lots of people standing around in the same room at the end of a movie does not an oscar win. Unfortunetly, neither does it satisfy the watcher, or even give them a clear idea of what they just watched. This wasn't an artsy film either where you expect that. I left with the feeling someone took a pair of scissors to the reel of a movie, and I was watching what was left.",0
"I put this product on my 4 chihauhau's and they experienced severe reactions. Two of them had severe itching, redness of their skin, and hair loss. I will never use any of these toxic flea repellents again. I will only use natural means of flea control. I implore you to read up on these products before applying them to your animals. It has taken almost 6 weeks for these symptoms to cease. The fleas themselves were not causing the problems that this product caused. I have researched and found a natural flea control from the cedarcidestore.",0

"Mariah has one of the best female voices of all time. She lacks the power that Whitney and Aretha have but her voice is almost just as soulful. Mariah sings down to her lowest note C3 at the beginning of EMOTIONS and sings an ascending scale up to E7. But her highest note is G7 (in a live performance of EMOTIONS). This is just over a 4.5 octave range and is close to 5 full octaves, the widest range known to man.You're going to enjoy Emotions, You're So Cold, Can't Let Go, and Make it Happen. All of these were some of her greatest hits and I've enjoyed them since i was a child.",1
"I am amazed at the enthusiastic reviews this book has received. It is such a poorly written, poorly conceived story that I was actually laughing out loud as I read it...Could anybody really take either the story or the writing seriously? First, the sentences were baggy and run-on. There were lots (and lots) of adjectives and other verbiage that added nothing and clarified nothing. Then, the character development was not believable: a snitty little tattle-tale grows up to be Florence Nightengale. And even if she did, what would make me care? Does she have any thoughts, depth, emotions, life events that would make her interesting. I can't say because it is neither explicit nor implicit in the book, despite a profusion of unnecesary detail. Lastly, the story line -requiring too much suspended belief for my taste- is far too thin to support 300 odd pages. Where is all the hype and enthusiasm coming from?",0
"I found this Brunetti mystery less murky and more straightforward than most of the others in this series, despite the title. It's fascinating to get out to Murano and learn how the Venetian glass industry works, in a remarkably low-tech, individual workshops way. Leon's concerns about the environment continue to be a theme, counterbalanced by the beauty of Venice in the Spring. So it's one of my favorite of the Brunetti books, and I highly recommend it.",1
"Because I already own The Red Pocket Book of Spanish Verbs in hardcopy I didn't bother to sample it first. That was a mistake I'll never make again. The hardcopy book is a wonderful and useful reference, but the Kindle version is so poorly formatted that it is virtually unusable. This is an egregious example of a publisher simply converting from paper to electronic format with no thought to the differing requirements of the two media! Trying to look up a single verb is nearly impossible.",0

I notice my PC boots faster now that Norton is off, and programs load faster :D",0
"I have to agree with other reviewers. I've owned several Prevention videos, and this one just doesn't live up to the brand. The interval routine alone is so boring, repetitive, bouncy, and uncreative, and the instructor so distracting that I can't even finish a lousy 21 minutes. You repeat the same 3 steps (mambo, shuffles, high knees) over and over in the low-impact segment, and then in the high-impact segment, you repeat THE SAME THING all over again, only with a bounce in your step! Lots and lots of bouncing. (And ""Ilyse"" is supposed to continue the low-impact in that segment but you can see she didn't get the memo.) The instructor does a LOT of ""hup"" and ""nice"" to the point of distraction. Honest, if she's doing anything more after that, I don't know because although my body could keep going, the rest of me said ""enough.""",0
"This movie was SO bad. Based on anime, yet nary an Asian actor within a country mile. Special effects, as Beavis and Butthead would say, weren't very special. And neither is this movie.

I watched this movie last night which was vary funny but I have not been able to find out if it was ever released in theathers or if it was straight to video.

I could give a good revue of all of Karen Kingsbury books but this one was particularly touching. I am sure that all adoptiveparents have the fear that the child they are raising could be taken back someday by the birth parents. In this case thebirth father was a cruel and heartless man. The birth mother showed her generous love for her son by finding a wayto let the adoptive parents continue to have custody of the little boy.,1
"One hundred woodblock prints of the 20th-century Japanese artist Hasui are cataloged in bright colors on large pages roughly 9"" x 11"". Captions for the hundred are grouped following the prints. With annotations which are comments by Hasui on the particular print or informative remarks by Narazaki Munishige, editor of a book on the artist's prints, the captions are instructive. Instructive too are two introductory essays by Kendall H. Brown. The first is on the Japanese cultural sources of Hasui's prints; the second focuses on Hasui's life and art. The succinct text with the appealing pictures of numerous prints offers an ideal introduction to and sampling of the woodblock prints by this outstanding Japanese artist who is regarded as one of the primary artists of the 20th-century Japanese art movement known as ""New prints"" (Shin-hanga).",1

"Cardcaptor Sakura is truly one of the best shoujo anime out on the market today. The ending of the series is as good as the rest, the main highlight being Sakura's final battle.

"OK, like everyone else I read all the reviews before deciding on this pan. And everyone was right about the phenomenal properties of this nonstick. However, no one seemed to mention that the handle is far from ergonomically correct. It is way too small for the heft of this pan. The pan actually turns over in my hand when I'm lifting it, and I'm not a tiny person with small hands. I'm sticking with the professional line until I see some design changes. C'mon, Calphalon, do some homework!! And in spite of what anyone says about the professional becoming less than nonstick over time, I've had mine for over a year, and with daily use it's still like new. Take good care of it, and remember there's a lifetime warranty against defect.",0

"This has been an extremely useful book as I have been struggling with the ""Most Painful Problem in Business"" as Patrick Lencioni puts it. In our company we have many back-back meetings and most of the days it feels like all you do is go from meeting to meeting. I have also been guilty of conducting unproductive meetings. So when I came across this book and read the first pages it felt like the perfect book that can help me solve the problem that I was struggling with. After completing the book, I now have very clear guidelines as to how make meetings more productive. I am completely bought on the ""mining conflict"" concept. Also useful is deciding on what type of meeting it is going to be ""Daily Check-In"", ""Weekly Tactical"", ""Monthly Strategic"" or ""Quarterly Off-site"". For those of you struggling with the quantity and quality of meetings, this is an excellent book that gives you many insights and practical steps to make your meetings better.",1

"Geri 'Ginger' Halliwell shines on this, her first solo album. Everyone knew she'd record, but I don't think anyone was ready for how GOOD the album is.

Pearl and Luke are two people who are perfect for each other and yet, due to stations in life, can never be together. I found Pearl so endearing and her passion about helping others is so contagious. Luke is someone who has suffered and yet risen to help others suffering. Both were easy to love and made this book a keeper. Unfortunately, the following books of the series drag endlessly and are not worth the time. So only read this book if you can restrain yourself from wondering what happens to Luke's best friend. I will save you the effort: think same exact plot but with no twists and undeveloped characters.",1

"Sadly, I bought this book based entirely on its look (which, admittedly, is rather pretty) without having read any of the passages first.While ""Journal"" may contain a murder, it was certainly no mystery. I saw the final conclusion from a mile away. What this book lacks in solid, believable characterization, it makes up for in sugary sentiment. Add to that the overly precious, self-conscious nature of the writing and the completely unbelievable dialogue between characters and what you have is a shiny, hardbound waste of time.Do yourself a favor and buy something, anything, else.",0
"This mousepad may seem as a great product but at times the rest becomes a little bit tiresome, and I think it get's in the way of my hand and the mouse. It did take me a great deal of time to get used to this pad but anyone else who use's it has found it in the way and annoying. I have to agree with this, b/c it truly does get into the way of my hand and its a little bit confusing. Also it is much bigger than most mousepad's it takes up a great deal of space.",0

"My husband bought a DX6340 and was pleased with it so I bought one, too. Shortly after that the battery door on his camera broke and would not close. A few months later when I took my camera out of the camera bag I discovered my battery door was broken and would not close. I contacted Kodak for repair. They would not sell a battery door. They wanted $105 to fix it or they would sell me a trade in for $199. My camera was only a little over a year old and mechanically fine except for the broken door. I will not buy another Kodak product.",0

"I am not impressed by this fan - it seems impossible to find a well made oscillating table fan these days. Most of the fans are the tower type fan and I have been looking for months to find a ""old fashion"" well made table fan and I thought this was it... I was wrong. As it rotates, it gets to one side and kind of flops over - I'm sure this is simply a defect in my particular fan but it does high-light how poorly it is made. It has little power and the components are poorly made. I am disappointed with this fan and would not recommend it to anybody.",0
"The Fundamentals of Play is a phenomenal novel of manners in the tradition of The Great Gatsby. Now, I've never been a fan of Gatsby nor will I ever become one, however Macy has weaved a story of such depth and breadth that one cannot help becoming intimately involved in the characters and their lives - lives of money, posh private clubs, boarding schools and Ivy League colleges.I think what strikes me as unbelievable is that this story is written by a woman. Ms. Macy is so astonishing a writer that she can have readers truly believe in the male narrator. All characters are very well developed and multifaceted, retaining both enviable and less-than-admirable qualities.I had this sitting on my ""to read"" shelf for quite a while but now I'm pained that I waited this long to read it. Truly a triumph.",1

"Although I might not go into great detail, I just want to say- I rented this movie, but wish I had it on dvd (my own collection) I thought the storyline was decent and had a surprise or two in it. I like the last person on Earth subject (scary-to say the least) I would say, if you arent sure you want to buy it---its as simple to just rent it. I am glad I took the time to watch it!",1
The book is far better.But this is a solid entertainment offering and does a decent job of staying close to the Adam's classic.,1
"Vanessa-Mae is one of these ""child prodigy's"" that never developed. While she posesses great technical skill, she lacks an understanding of the music and is therefore unable to make meaningful interpretations. To compensate, Vanessa-Mae has opted for what I call ""classical-pop"" - classically based music spiced up to ""wow"" the listener. I'm sure there's a place for this style of music, but I find it trite and shallow and I shall not allot any of my shelf space for this video.",0
"Good Charlotte is one of the best new pop-rock bands out there today. If you listen to their entire CD all the way through, you can hear the chunks of songs straight from the Clash and the Sex Pistols' handbook. Not only do they rock recorded, they totally RULE live! They actaully try to get in touch with their fans, its awesome! The band members are: Joel, Vocals; Benji, Guitar, vocals; Billy, Guitar; Paul, Bass; Aaron, Drums. If you've done any research on the band, you would know that almost all of their songs are auto-biographical...which makes the meaning and the feelings even deeper. Good Charlotte's singles include ""Little Things"", ""Motivation Proclamation"", and ""The Click"" - the theme song on MTV's underGRADS (go to mtv.com and download it!). They all totally rock! Never miss the chance to catch them live...or you'll wanna kick youself for it!",1
"Life just isn't fair sometimes. The Ataris are becoming famous while an amazing group like Ethyline remains in obscurity. This is a great band! If you like Jimmy Eat World or The Ataris, you should really own this CD because Ethyline is better than both of 'em! Powerful guitars, great singing, great songs and just a really good band. I highly recommend this CD.",1
"I purposely bought this unit as it was one of two on the market with wireless rear speakers. Unfortunately, within a day of plugging it in, I noticed that tell-tale electric smell that says ""something's not happy in the unit"", coming from the disc changer. I hadn't even tried to plug in speakers yet since we had just finished the basement room this was meant for and had been using the HDMI cable to just play through the TV sound. Once the smell had cleared, nothing worked, no video, no sound, no nothing. I have had to pay $26 to send it to New Jersey for repair or replacement so I really can't comment on it's overall quality yet, much less the sound. I'll wait to see whether the replacement or repair is functional or report back on any difficulties this might entail. So, for now, I give this a thumbs down, especially since it has cost me more money and I am unable to use it during this interim.",0
I did not think any of this collection was worth the listen. Disappointed as have heard some gems from that era but this copy did not have any for my taste.,0
"I'm not the typical person who likes silly long out dramas about a bunch of people I could care less about(Legends of the Fall makes me physically sick). After watching a bunch a WB shows about earnest perfect looking teens (Can anyone say Dawson's Creek)I was expecting the same thing with this movie. Though everyone does have perfect skin and designer clothes, I found the characters in Cruel Intentions to be anything but earnest. Reese Witherspoon is excellent as Annette, playing more of the saavy teen than heartbroken and tormented. Sarah Michelle Gellar was the perfect bitch and Ryan Phillipe made my heart beat a little faster. Though it won't win any Academy Awards for Best Screenplay, Cruel Intentions is defintly a movie I enjoy.",1
"The only part of this movie that's worth the trouble is a one-line moment towards the very end.Beyond that, this movie reflects the stereotyped view Indians have of Americans, and the picture's not a happy one.Nor does it do much for the real side of Eastern spirituality, which this movie also stereotypes.Don't bother - this one's a waste of time.",0
"A pal of mine gave me this book as a Christmas present a few years ago; and in my intermittent waves of cooking frenzy vs. dieting I regret to say I've only tried one recipe. It is, however, so killer that it's worth what she paid for the book. It's called ""Kit's Chocolate Mousse"" and is the ultimate mousse for those of us who like it thick and frothy [unlike pudding, which is gooey and drippy.] You can both gain weight and salivate just reading the ingredients, including [brace yourself] 2 cups of heavy cream and 6 eggs.If I ever get around to the rest of the book, I'll start with the recipe for Mexican chocolate. The photography is excellent, the layout is charming, and the recipes only for the serious chocolate lover.",1
"I was really quite happy with this guitar -- nice amp, beautiful design, good sound -- but within a day of playing it, the notes on the first fret stopped working, giving a ""twang"" sound instead of a note. I tried adjusting all the adjustable features, but it just got worse and worse. I can't tell if I just happened to get a lemon, or if they all break eventually.I ended up exchanging it for a ""Squier"" by FenderSquier by Fender Stop Dreaming-Start Playing Set: Affinity Special w/ Fender 15G Amplifier, Metallic Blue-- I recommend that one instead -- it's better built, more reputable brand, and a bit more fun to play (though a bit more expensive).The good news is that Amazon is GREAT with returns, they took it right back, and even paid for shipping.",0
"I had seen the infomercials for this product. I wanted something that my wife and kids could use to help out with the lawn, and this looked perfect. However, it was completely dissapointing. It had no power, the cord did not seem to feed properly, it would not edge neatly as shown.I returned it, and will probably replace with a gas powered unit again.",0
"Mr. Montignac is the real deal. I have friends in Europe who have been eating the 'Montignac way' for years, but until this book was published in the US he was unknown to me. Four weeks ago I began following Mr. Montignac's eating plan, and I have discovered a new and wonderful way to eat. I have lost the weight I wanted to lose (8 pounds), I'm no longer addicted to sugar (I basically lived on sweets and pasta), and I'm eating plenty. I love 'The French Diet' because it includes recipes, easy to follow eating information, and the science behind the eating methods. I plan to follow the French diet forever -- it's not really a diet, but a way of life.",1
"I bought two of these and neither of them work. Unfortunately I did not save the packaging so into the trash they go.I tried the bubble solution that came in the package as well as other brands, and the bubble machine fails to produce bubbles consistently. You are better off with a single wand and blow your own.Save your money. Don't buy this product.",0
"This is not a heavy duty, commercial juicer. With less than 20 uses, I have already fried the motor (juicing apples) and stripped the plastic bolt that the blade rests on, juicing a mango. I have tried to contact lequip numerous times to exercise my warranty, but I have never heard back from them. I can not recommend this product.",0
"After borrowing the CD from my friend, I just had to get it for myself. I was not disappointed.Jack White's voice is unique and gets the job done. He can sing in a variety of styles. Though most people who like the White Stripes also like the Strokes, the two are completely different.The songs on this album range from upbeat ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" to mild ""Same Boy You've Always Known"". All songs have are reminiscent of days gone by.There's nothing extremely hard on this CD, but nothing boring either. Any rock fan should enjoy it.",1

"The Dreamcast is certainly worth your money at 100 bucks. It's a decent gaming console, and the graphics it produces are nothing short of stunning. The games that are out are great; Crazy Taxi is addictive and fun, and I hear the sports titles are top-of-the-line. It has four-player support, a major reason why I'm a little irked at Sony for not realizing its mistake, as four-player support is a must! (Sure, you could buy the Multi-Tap, but it's extra money and extra cords... who needs that?) Dreamcast is great. It'll be great in five years when you look back at your collection and have a hankering for some ""classic"" games. Hopefully you'll pick one up before it becomes a collector's item, because it really is a great system. Too bad it only lasted a year and a half in production; the only thing that suffers is the size of your library, not the quality of your experience!",1
"I never buy CDs for myself, but I had to buy Clay's as soon as it came out! His voice is perfect, and I love listening to him...over and over again. :) I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed Clay's singing at anytime during the competition. Although he didn't win the title, he is definitely my American Idol!",1
"The shampoo itself was good, the shipping speed okay, but the bottle was NOT full. Some of the product was missing. I double checked the product level in this size bottle at a retail location, and it was where one would expect it to be. My estimates are that I was shorted at least 3-4 oz....so, either this bottle was not filled to capacity as it should have been at the factory, or product went missing somewhere along the line. With the amount product that was missing from the bottle, versus what I saved buying online, I would better off buying retail. Buyer Beware.",1
BabyBjörn Little Potty - GreenI was surprised by the size of this potty when I received it! It was much smaller than I expected. But it has been PERFECT for our son! It's very simple and uncomplicated. And it's easy to clean. It is GREAT for potty training on the go! We take this potty it us everywhere!!! I would definitely recommend this potty!!!!,1
"This is my first ever sewing machine. My in-laws got it for me last Christmas (I had it on my wishlist) and I love it! I have used it so far mostly to make rugs and baby blankets and its handled fairly well. I love that it is very light and has a little ""handle"" carrying hole, which has been very useful! I do agree with some other reviewers that it has too many options and fancy stitches that I don't personally care about, but I just don't use them! :) I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a seamstress using this machine! :) I would definitely recommend this machine, especially to those who are new to sewing and just need something inexpensive.",1
I had high expectations for this book but what a letdown...it was just plain dull.,0
I anxiously bought this release only to find that someone though the films would be better if new music was added to the soundtrack. The case says it has the original audio but it doesn't say that music has been added. Thank goodness I was able to exchnage this disc for something else. Why can't they leave things alone?,0

"This thing is just not good.First, the touch-free part only works if a) the bin is pretty much completely empty and b) the batteries are pretty much brand new. Another words...it rarely ever works.Second, the smell!!!!! Everytime you open it up to throw away a diaper you will be hit with this horrendous smell...and before you think ""well, you need to change it more""...her is our routine. We empty it every 3-4 days. We DO NOT throw poopy diapers in it, we take those out to the garbage in the garage. We change the little filter every month like we are supposed to. We use deoderant garbage bags and spray it down with lysol everytime we change it.So...it's not us. It's the diaper pail. Save you money...this is a piece of very smelly junk.Get a diaper dekor...or better yet, just throw your diapers away in your regular garbage. It's cheaper and your LO will enjoy the ""field trip""",0
"Having data and power in the same cable is VERY useful. Considering the advances in cabling, however, I would think that having ONLY a DB-9 serial data cable is a limitation. For example, I'm now looking for an adaptor from the DB-9 to USB. That being said, it's a very useful connector, and it DOES work with the SporTrak Pro, not just the Meridian. A data cable is included with the SporTrak Pro, but not an external power cable. There is a less expensive power cable, but if you want to have both power and data, this is the only way to go, since there's only one connection on the GPSR.",1
"What happened to Barbie?!?!?!?! She has a different voice and now has a pointy chin with huge, bulging eyes. She looks like a Bratz doll, and I can't stand the Bratz doll look. Don't like that they've made Barbie an ""actress"" in this story who has ""acted"" in past Barbie movies. It was hard to explain to my daughter why characters in this movie looked like characters from other Barbie movies. Much prefer when Barbie sat down to tell a story and that is how the movie would come to be. And why do they always have to make one of Barbie's friends a goof? My daughter loves these movies, but I think I really need to rethink allowing her to watch them (and me purchasing them for her).On a good note, there was a piece in the ""extras"" on the woman who works for Mattel as a fashion designer and did all the clothes for this movie. That was fun and interesting. And my daughter LOVES the dance videos.",0
"This unbelievably slow-paced game adds nothing new to the genre: Empire Earth 2 is just ""yet another"" RTS. The plethora of units only detracts from the game (who needs to memorize 300+ units and their special characteristics), and the division of the game into ""territories"" has been one of the worst ideas EVER.This game has been reviewed as ""Rise of Nations""-esque. Don't waste your money with this, as Rise of Nations is a better game than this will ever become. The plethora of resources (remember, Rise of Nations already has had complaints about the number of resources IT has, Empire Earth II just increases even more resources you have to run around) are not manageable as there IS no idle-citizen auto-control.All-in-all: Empire Earth II may contain some brilliant ideas, but the entirety of the game is pure, utter crap.",0
"I mainly wanted to see this movie because of the location--I live in Raleigh, NC and the Outerbanks is truly one of the most beautiful places on this earth. However, the beauty of the location was overshadowed by the sheer awfulness of this movie. Predictable, schmatlzy, and just plain bad--I was p.o'ed that I wasted 1 hr 36 minutes of my life watching this crappy movie. I expected more from Lane and Geer, both seasoned actors. Admittedly, I'm not the demographic this movie targets, but come on, who could really believe this crap? Just say no and skip this one.",0

"This season is the hands down best season in all of the Rurouni Kenshin series. Anything cool or stylish or dramatic that you really want to happen, keeps your shoulders tense for a while, even if you know wether it will happen or not.

"Having used this book for a few semesters, I offer you this: Avoid this book, unless you too are an academic who has nothing real to offer the world of video games in terms of game design or actual game production.If you are the same type of person that enjoys diagramming sentences or likes to discuss why other people have created artistic things in the manner they did - rather than create something yourself, then you may enjoy this.[...] I am of the opinion that a person writing on such a topic might be better equipped to do so after having designed a few AAA titles. Then again, people like that tend to be busy working on games.Buyer beware. I was required to buy this book and was unable to ""Dodge this bullet"". To each, their own.",0

"my 2 yo has had it for 2 weeks, and after the first day hasn't picked it up again. This toy is heavy, the mechanical noises are loud and movements jerky. It's not very cuddly and it's hard to carry.

She's played more with creative nonelectronic toys, or electronic toys that play more songs she can sing and dance to. A toy only for the elmo or hokey-pokey obsessed.",0
"I dropped in at a Borders book store, spotted the series of Beaux Arts Editions, picked up the volume ""Spectacular Israel"" and sampled a couple of pages - without exception, breathtaking pictures. But then I looked at a map of Israel that stretched from the Mediterranian Sea to Jordan... no trace of the Occupied Territories. Someone who viewed the book before me must also have became aware of the terrible ommission and crudely sketched in the borders of the Gaza Strip and the West Bankand. I was outraged over this land grab (I know plenty of Jews support it) and reported my finding to the store manager (Borders). No matter how beautiful the book but when it so bluntly disregards international borders it has immediately lost its attraction, al least to me. There ARE priorities in my choices...",0
"I had heard that there was a possibility that Season 2 would be split into 2 sets.

"I wish I would have read all the reviews before I bought this table. Both of the chairs had to be repaired. The wood was split where they were put together. The top of the table looks like the stain has been sprayed on and has dry spots. I am very disappointed, but didn't feel like spending the extra money to send it back. I just paid someone to fix the chairs. For this kind of money I would have expected better quality.",0
The receiver outlet seems well made and has heavy duty specs to handle up to 20 amps. I'm using it with my JDS 1.5HP dust collector. This is hosed up using blast gates to a variety of machines in my wood shop so having a portable remote transmitter is perfect. I'm not sure what the max. range is but I've never had a problem in a 25' x 30' area. Minor point but including a wall holster for the transmitter remote would have been useful. Final thought: only wish I had bought this long ago.,1

"A fine effort by James Horner, brilliantly scored, elegantly played, truly a magnificent CD all-around. The layering and usage of many different instruments, yet the constancy of one tune over many tracks, is particularly effective and emotional. The soundtrack brings back so many memories from the original film, it takes you back in mind to the scenes, making it a truly great soundtrack. Its only flaw: the exclusion of the Irish jigs, which I think were fundamental in creating two different moods in the movie. I think that their inclusion would have created a contrasting sound that would have shown the scope of the movie more. Nevertheless, a fine score by Horner. END",1
We bought this for my son when he was one. He is now 2 and a half and he still loves it as much as he did then. It keeps him entertained for hours.,1
"I thought that these batteries would (as promised in the advert.)last 8x longer than regular Alkalines - NOT. I guesstimate that I get about 40% more time on both my cameras, but not the 8x promoted. For the price (double to triple the cost)they are not worth it.",0
I am not much of a television viewer.....but.....WOW! I am so glad my brother and sister-in-law got me started on Downton Abbey. I will only be watching on DVD because it is more complete and I don't have to stop after just one hour. Incredible production! Dame Maggie Smith is perfection! Entire cast is perfect for their parts.,1
"The Mr. Coffee carafe was configured with the pour spout in the wrong place. It should be on the side but this item had the spout at the opposite end of the handle. Not very convenient to pour and was not as shown in the picture. I would not buy this item again and if another breaks, I will go to Walmart.",0
The Waring looks like an industrial-strength juicer. My previous one was mostly plastic. This one is largely made out of stainless steel. Looks and works great and I love the price!,1
"I ordered this book and was going to return it because it is such poor quality but it wasn't worth the return postage. I put it in the recycling bin instead. Seriously! I was surprised to see so many good reviews that I felt it was my duty to report otherwise. Try doing a web search if you are looking for Irish baby names rather than wasting the money on this book. You can see by my signature that we went a different route entirely (this was not caused by the terrible quality of the book, however! We decided our surname was good enough).",0
"I was excited to read this book. It sounded imaginative, fun and different; especially when somebody compared this to the works of the late Douglas Adams. Instead, it was just boring. I read about half this book and it just did not grab me. No, I'm sorry, not at all. I've since decided to move on to something different.",0
"all i want to say is that i regret when i ever bought ANY sailor moon manga. Its very bad for the younger crowd and pretty boring for the older ones. Naoko might be a good artist, but she's definitly not a good story writer. The stort repeats its self five or six times through out all the sailormoon manga series. The pictures get worse and worse every time and the plot gets really ruined, (ESPECIALY at the last few pages in the last book [its terrible!!]). Smaller kids might enjoy it though its very bad for them (I wouldn't recommend it for ANY parent to let their kids read these things). The author, Naoko, might've done a good job at the begining, but she DEFINITLY over did it and ruined it in the end! For those who are just so impressed by SailorMoon (anime or manga), believe me, i've been through that phase and do regret it a lot now. Not recommended at all!",0
Use these in my studio and they work great! Can pump a lot of volume through these without them distorting.,1
"This album will worm its way under your skin until you find yourself listening to it alone on a Thursday night, wondering if the way you're feeling is really what you're feeling, or if you're only feeling it because Damien's music makes you feel it. It grows and matures with every listen.If you buy this album I would caution you against associating it with any particular person or relationship, as you'll have to put it away for good if that relationship ends. Trust me on this one. It's that potent.Damien is, frankly, not to be missed, even if he breaks your heart.",1
"I recommend this movie highly. It's so funny and sad all in one, but it's real and what can happen in a family. Very heart warming.",1
"Bob James music has been a major soundtrack for my life since 1974 (and Earl Klugh 1977) replacing the Beatles(rock)of my adolescence as a major influence! The compilation as a whole is excellent but I was really disappointed by the edits of ""Kari"" and ""Feel Like Making Love"". Anyone not familiar with Bob James' music probably wouldn't notice a thing and still enjoy these tracks. The only thing I could relate this to in some manner, is like hearing the ""Top 40"" version of ""Light my Fire"" by the Door's or ""Oye Como Va"" by Santana versus the longer versions on the albums.The edit of ""Kari"" trucates Earl Klugh's ""gorgeous"" acoustic guitar solo and the edit of ""Feel like Making Love"" chops Bob James electric piano solo that defines so much of the style of his later work!",1
"Dr. Sidney Blake developed a competent and thorough compilation of vascular plants in his hometown, totaling more than a thousand taxa. It's a unique baseline for additional study.",1
This is an excellent book with a lot of helpful information. The experiences it shares are excellent. It is also extremely well written!,1
"We learn that Hercule Poirot has taken up the study of classic mysteries and his knowledge of these leads him to solve the mystery in this particular case.Colin Lamb, a young marine biologist and Intelligence agent, is paying a visit to Wilbraham Crescent when a young girl comes running out of one of the homes. She is screaming that she has found a dead man inside. Indeed, a corpse is there surrounded by a room filled with clocks set to 4:13, although it is only 3:13. Colin takes the problem to his father's old friend, Hercule Poirot, who at once pronounces it a ""simple"" case. Two more murders, an unidentifiable body, a mysterious secretarial school, and the search for a clever spy are the clues that Poirot's little grey cells must sift through before he reveals the answer to this ""simple"" case.",1
"If your looking for some real music by a real muscian, than Peter Stone Brown's ""Up Against It"" is your destination.A wouderful blend of Folk, Blues and Rock that never disapoints, unlike what the mass recording business pushes on the public today. Mr. Brown delivers true, heart felt songs from the amusing to the sorrowful, it never misses to move the listener.",1
I did not get the product in the picture!! This was in no way the item that I expected and I'm sorry that I got it!!,0
the book came and the binding wasn't together it had to be taped to keep the pages from falling apart was unhappy about the condition of the book,0
"Ive only played the demo version of this game but ive already become addicted! My parents say I buy too many games and I cant get any more(Oh man!)but if I could I would for sure buy GC. This game in a word ROCKS! Its well worth your money. And if u cant get it right away(like me) find someway to get the demo! Awsome units and the best graphics, a chalenge but still fun! Buy it.",1
"This is the best of both Miss Marple and Poirot to have for your movie collection as it not only is a good introduction to the two great sleuths but also has ""extras"" about them as well as the author herself. A must have addition for any of Christie's fans. Also the actors. Joan Hickson and David Suchet, who portray the great detectives are the best. It is as if the great dame of mystery, Agatha Christie herself, used them as the models for her two best loved characters.",1
"Preparing a protection from abuse order for a client turns into protecting that client from a charge of murder and from organized crime, unknown attackers, and sundry other trouble for a suburban Maryland lawyer.The locale is unusual, the characters sympathetic, and the plot well done. I recommend it for anyone looking for a mature (both in the sense of a lot of the action taking place in a ""gentlemen's club"" and in the sense of readers who do not expect ninja warriors popping up from the scenery) crime fiction book.And it's competently edited and proofread, by the way, which sets it apart from the herd, including a lot of best-sellers.",1
I was hoping that this would be a thought provoking scifi drama...but it was a predictable and poorly acted mess.There was nothing particularly endearing about any pf the characters and I ended up not caring what happens to them.I hope they all get blown away.,0
"I had purchased a Cuisart earlier this year and have been looking for a better hand blender. I went with Bamix because of the reviews and the ability to change blades. To give you and idea how picky I am with my kitchen tools - I use only le creuset, all clad and shun knives. Quality matters.- pros:- good balance, powerful motor, makes great mash potatoes. It puts my potato ricer to shame.- cons:non detachable head (not important for me, but could be for some)handle a bit bigger than my cusinart. My hands aren't too big. Might be a problem for some females.Bottom line: It is worth it. Very well built.",1
Purchased for my son...WOW what a picture...also comes with some fun software to play with...funny hair that moves around with you as you move,1
This wireless router is flaky. It will work for a while and then stop accepting new wireless connections for no apparent reason.I have the lastest firmware (Nov 2006) and use WPA/WPA2 with long passphrases. I also tried various settings (such as wireless B/G only) to no avail. The relatives that use this unit at their home are very frustrated.,0
"This oven does everything perfectly! Perfect pizza (fresh or frozen), rotisserie chicken done to juicy perfection, broiling, baking and so on. So easy to clean up - pretty much just rinse off! I highly reccommend this oven, well worth the cost.",1
"Wow, I am continuously amazed at people. This book is nothing but an example of ""distraught"" parents cashing in on their kid's moment of fame. Its melodramatic, right-wing fundamentalist fiction. This kid was no martyr and her story isn't anything special. She was obviously just another teenager who'd never been permitted to think for herself. The only tragedy here is that she died before she could realize there is life outside the crazed control of hysterical parents. Her ""mother"" if she can be called that, deserves the money she's made off this book. She sold her soul for it.If you read this book, be prepared to be saddened by the scope of this woman's greed and self-righteousness. Someday, when the limelight dies down, she might even get around to mourning the daughter she really lost (and not just the one she has created for the media).",0
I'm finally fed up with the high cost of HP Vivera ink cartridges and NOT BEING ABLE TO PRINT WITH BLACK ONLY if a color cartridge runs out. I'll just go buy a different product that will print with black only (when I decide that's what I want to do) because that represents the majority of my printing tasks.,0
"Poor quality overall. Back wheels would splay out, like you would expect under heavy load, while cart was empty. Overtightening bolts to try to correct this strips and breaks the nut, so wheels then fall off. Cart also does not fold/unfold squarely - the metal grid gets off-kilter.",0
"I also had the battery latch break within the first month. I returned the camera for a new one, and the latch broke several weeks later. I decided to keep the camera anyway, but after a year and a half, the flash quit working. I was offered the $135 repair or a refurbished Z650 for $199. I can get the Z650 new for $210 at Circuit City. I also have to wonder, why are so many refurbished cameras available? Stay away from Kodak, even thought it took nice pics.",0
"As a beginner, this book was a real disappointment. I'm sure Mr. Windwalker had better advice but kept it to himself. If you're just curious, go for it. But I certainly did not find $17 worth of information it in--nothing I didn't already know that is.",0
"This game proved to be challenging and held my attention for hours on end. The possibilities are endless which adds to thechallenge of the game.Would highly recommend for anyone who is a fan of ER, and this game will prove entertaining long after the duration of the television show.",1
"I don't have children yet, but my profession is a photographer, and with infants so little it's sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose, the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look, you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want, so next time you go to get those special memories captured, bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy, ( i also prop it up a little if they are on a table, and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears) Congrats to all and many smiles!!!",1
GEE WHIZ VICTOR- This new 2nd edition is much better than the 1st in regard to durabilty. The cover is glossier and the title is correctly printed on the spine.The book does not fall apart as did the Chile version. I find this edition better in all regards. SOMEONE write the script and make it to cable or at least video.,1
"""The Who by Numbers"" marks the transistion of songwriter Pete Townshend from youth to middle age. By and large, the album sounds more like his own first solo album (the laid back ""Who Came First"") than it does like previous work by the band. From this point on, Townshend would focus on the themes of middle-age uncertainty rather than the arrogance of youth. The man who once had wanted to die before he got old began to contemplate getting old. This is a solid studio album with a number of Who classics like ""Slip Kid"" and ""Squeeze Box."" For that, its worth owning.",1
"Yes, I bought this rice cooker and the rice came out perfect, except for the fact that the cooker died within a month, after only about 8 uses. I would try another brand.",0
Okay there are almost 4000 reviews but I am going to add my opinion to the pile.This book re-ignited my love for books in a way I could have ever expected. I loved the way the story unfolded and the love and attraction between Bella and Edward grew throughout the story. It reminded me of first love and I felt a real connection to the characters. I have read the book over a dozen times and was instantly recruited into the army of Twilighters.,1
"This book has something.If they made a movie of it, it could be edited differently.Just like Jaws was.I see a future in it.They can change the end a little differently,making it more realistic.People like mystery.Not subs going into a shark.I can see maybe biting into the sub.Also get someone who can conduct great music for it.NOT SOME UNKNOWN.Music helps in a film alot,and acting",1
Got another small kit thing instead. Decided not to bother with returns and reshipping of correct item as it would not get here for Christmas.,0
"Two issues:1. Your parts selections show 1998 Dodge 2500 trucks but allow no distinction between gasoline and diesel models on the parts, specifically brake rotors and the steering pump.2. There is no link that I can find on your web that allows a specific question about a part. Only a review of the part is allowed which is what I am using here, but I am not reviewing the part/s but the means to ask questions about parts. Thank you.David",0
"If you're a pretentious egghead, you may enjoy this book. If you're a fan of Love or ""Forever Changes,"" you will not.I bought this because I'd enjoyed the book in the same series (by a different author) about the Kinks' ""... Village Green Preservation Society"" album. That book discussed the songs on the Kinks album (and others that were recorded for it, but not included) individually and in detail, and contained plenty of interesting information about the making of the album. In contrast, this book, supposedly about ""Forever Changes,"" contains little of interest about that album, instead wasting its pages on yawn-inspiring examinations of Gnosticism, intellectual musings on prophecy, and even self-analysis by the author(!).I agree with the reviewer below who compared Hultkrans' ""Forever Changes"" book to a doctoral thesis. If you enjoy reading those, by all means buy this book. If you want to read about ""Forever Changes,"" look elsewhere.",0
"Don't purchase this item ! I purchased this flashlight as a gift for an elderly relative and after installing the batteries it flickered and died. Since I kept it for > 30 days before I was out of luck returning it. My bad. So, I ordered a new unit and apologized to my mother-in-law for the defective gift. We installed the batteries and presto: nothing. This unit was completed dead. I least I can send this one back. Also, I noted that both the rear and front screw caps emitted metal shavings when removing/re-iinstalling. Overall this is not a quality product to say the least.",0
Love these slippers. Very comfortable and look good too! Are not the 'overly fluffy' variety that UGG slippers can sometimes be. Perfect amount of softness while still looking manly.,1

"For what it is, Atlanta Walks is a decent book with good maps and useful information on area sites. However, before you buy it know that most of these walks are around 5 miles long! To me, this is mostly for avid, athletic walkers and cyclists, not casual sightseers. I checked this out at the bookstore before purchasing it and was glad I did. I hoped to find more urban walks (no Cabbagetown, no Grant Park) and hoped they would be in the 1- to 2-mile range, highlighting more shopping and sightseeing opportunities. This is less for someone who wants to explore Atlanta, and more for someone who wants to exercise in an urban environment.",0
"I ordered an Acer laptop for my son for Christmas. He opened it yesterday and it wouldn't even boot. I contacted the Acer warranty department (after 20+ minutes on hold). They require that I pack the laptop safely. They require that I mail the laptop to them. They will repair it and return it (they indicated it would take at least 2 weeks). So essentially, I am out the time, effort, and expense of packing and shipping, my son has no present to enjoy for at least two weeks, and I paid new laptop price plus expenses for what will be a refurbished laptop by the time we first get to use it.I told Acer that I did not like their response (I wanted a replacement), and that I would publish my experience in as many places as possible for everyone to see. Their representative did not care. If enough people pass-up Acer they will learn to provide better customer service, or they will go out of business. I hope you will choose another laptop.",0
This book gives useful hints about planning a wedding and some of the issues that newly married couples will face. To present this book however as Catholic marriage prep is very misleading for the book at times contridicts approved Church teaching. There are other more reliable sources to read if you want to know what Catholic marriage prep is all about.,0

"As a long time fan of Roger Clyne's work, it pained me to listen to this album. The music here is akin to most adult-contemporary fare, so if that's your taste, then go ahead and buy this. However, if you want to hear the man at his peak, buy anything else he ever recorded (start at the Refreshments and work your way forward 'cause it just seems to be getting worse), just stay away from this weak drivel.",0
"I stumbled upon this book in a used bookstore, had no idea it was even out. Having enjoyed reading his CWG books, I grabbed it for a good read, but it was so much more than that. I was provoked in new ways, my beliefs du jour were challenged on every other page, I found myself writing notes till my fingers hurt...this is unusual for me as I have read ALL the books of this ilk for over 30 years and NEVER had such a response before. Since I enjoy being challenged and shaken up, it was an absolute mixture of joy and discomfort and ahas and oh ohs... If you are interested in the possibilities of what lies 'Beyond' this book gives a unique tour and I felt like I was 'there' (wherever 'there' might be!). I do not recommend this for the faint of heart or for those that are too sure in what they believe. For others it is a MUST!",1
"I'm sorry, but did I read the same book as the other reviewers? I purchased this book just knowing it was going to be off da chain just based on the reviews from this site. Damn I was wrong. I own every book in the B-boy Blues series and I must say that this maybe the worst of them all. What about going out with a bang? I gave this book 2 stars just because he caught us up pretty well with everyone. I consider the rest a jood mess.",0
"This is the second BFD I've purchased and it was for subwoofer EQ duties in a home theater. I have not kept up with the scene but I think this is still the one device that enthusiasts turn to when they want to beat their subwoofer's response into submission. It's so popular that Behringer discontinued it once but was forced to bring it back for sale. Combined with EQ Wizard and a decent instrumentation mic such as the Nady CM-100, you can get results that are far superior than the all-in-one sub EQ units from the expensive manufacturers.",1
"This book tries to get the learner to translate sentences into Norwegian by substituting isolated words and phrases. What the learner does, instead, is translates the Norwegian word or phrase into English and goes on reading the sentence! The sticker labels were the only useful part of this book, in my opinion. I have been studying and teaching Norwegian for years, and could suggest other books that are more helpful than this one.",0
"It is simple, and therefore has less ""stuff"" that malfunctions. No malfunctions, actually, to date. It steams well, pulls nice shots, is ready quickly. Clean it well and it'll treat you well.",1
"The Rebounder, the book, was an interesting book and that it keeps you on your feet. After you have started to read the book and really find out what's happening then you don't want to put the book down. After you have finished the book then you really start to think if you are an athlete. I mean even if you use to be one or even if you just play for fun at the park or in the back yard. My ratings on this book listed on a scale from one to ten and ten being the greatest then I'd probably give this book a nine. Toward the end of the idea the team manager, Mickey, has an excellent idea. He helps his friend get his head back on straight. If you like sports and you like reading sport books then your gonna love this one. You're not going to want to put the book down.",1
"""Beatles for Sale"" boasts original hits like ""Eight Days A Week"" in addition to cover songs like ""Rock and Roll Music"" by Chuck Berry and ""Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey"" by Little Richard.""No Reply,"" ""I'm A Loser,"" and ""Baby's in Black"" all demonstrate Lennon's drift into folk influences, also known as his ""Dylan"" stage, while McCartney churns out the melodic gem, ""I'll Follow The Sun.""Yet on this album, the greatest strength may be the Beatles versatility and marks a transition from one phase of their career to another. It is a healthy mix, almost 50/50, of cover songs and original tunes.The Beatles are also starting to develop some of the styles which define their original tunes, the hallmark of the famous Lennon/McCartney songwriting partnership.",1
"I was sent a pair of the HD280 headphones to try out. At first I was impressed by the look and quality of the Sennheisers, but after compairing them to my FOH engineers Sony MDR-V700 Headphones... well, the sound quality of the HD-280's are just plain terrible. Everyone who listened to them, crew, band, all thought the same... the Sonys sounded better. The HD-280's mid range seemed cut and the high end is brutal. Stick with the Sonys...",0

"An excellent quick review. This book is stream lined, easy to comprehend and fairly good with the number of drugs covered. It should be coupled with a more comprehensive text. I would have had a much more difficult time with my Pharmacology class without it. There is not enough chemistry, but then again it is a review. Overall - well worth adding to your library.",1

"We bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she totally loved it. We have more than 40 different DVDs including Disney movies, wiggles, Barney, Dora.... This is the only one can keep her focused for 2 hours every day (commute to/from her daycare). It has been months now and she is still watching it. The other day she wanted me to go with her do something and she suddenly said to me ""gen wo lai"", which is the Chinese for ""follow me"" that she learned from the DVD. It's the cutest thing in the world and made my day!",1

"I was a very big fan of Mrs. Hamilton's first Anita Blake books which contained detailed characters, a good plot, and quite a bit of humor. However these last few have basically turned everything around.With Anita's former best friend Ronnie as a complete b**** and Richard apparently going through some major issues the Anita Blake series has turned into something that reads like a low budget porn.I lost track of the number of scenes in this book althought I am fairly sure that made up a good half of it. Even Requiem went from being a somewhat interesting character to this junked up arduer sex fiend.The series has turned from a good supernatural detective series to cheap a harlequinn style with no plot and shallow characters.",0
"Being an avid reader of fantasy, this novel was very lacking. The plot was good, but the style of writing could have come from an eitgh-grader. What was missing was better writing skills, which discreetly completes a book. If you have ever read an anime novel, this is very much like it. Not good quality whatsoever. I suggest Eragon, or The City of Ember.",0
"I purchased one of these in May 2006, and 2 years, 2 months to the day it decided to just quit working, with no warning. Oh sure, I can sometimes see the folders on it, but they are now empty. I was going to give it 2 stars, because when it worked it was a handy little back-up drive - easy to trasfer between my desktop and laptop. But, because it had a relatively easy life - no daily use, just a few files added for storage maybe once every couple of weeks, and it bailed on me without notice, it should get 0 stars. The nice data recovery people tell me for $500 - $2100 they might be able to retrieve some of my data, but probably not all of it. Yeah, it used to looked cool on my desk, but no so much now.",0
"These clubs stink, they were alright at first, but I've had mine for about six months and two of them have already broken. They are alright beginner clubs but that's about it. I thought that it was my fault that the clubs broke, but I didn't even hit the ground whatsoever. I actually was hitting off of a tee with my 4-iron and the club-head snapped completely. I'm really disappointed at these clubs and I wish that the makers would replace them, but I doubt it. So if you're a beginner and that's all you want to be, then these are for you, but if you want a nice set of clubs, save up your money and buy some nice ones!",0
Not much to say other than it fits all my needs in an answering phone. Like especially the fast recharge of the hand units. Highly recommend!,1
"This movie was one of my favorites as a child and I just recently bought and watched it... It was as good as I remembered it. To top it all off, my daughter (age 1.5) LOVED the movie. She danced when they performed songs and everytime she tried to go play during the movie got distracted and stared back at the screen in mid walk. I would definately recommend this movie to ""kids"" of all ages.",1
"I used this on my puggle who has suffered from skin allergies. Because of all her itching, she's thickened the skin on her back. Our vet gave her an oral flea treatment two weeks after I treated my dog with Frontline because she was absolutely crawling with fleas.

Just a warning - i know that Frontline works well on our cat, so your pet probably could benefit from this only if it has normal, healthy skin.",0
"This is a movie about a dance hall girl simply wanting to find love and to improve her standard of life. It is probably the original Pretty Woman and I enjoyed its humour, music and simplicity. Great for a rainy afternoon with catchy songs. Shirley MacLaine is loveable and easy to listen to and her work associates are quite endearing showing a softer side. I enjoyed the choreography and unlike your average love story the ending is not what you expect.",1

"This book did a good job at exciting me. The more i read the more i because interested in how all these characters would intertwine. But i tell you, they didnt until the 3 very last chapters, and it was very dissapointing. The writer is good with all his descriptive words and really gets you into the characters, but for no apparent reason because they are totally discarded at the end.",0
"I saw this advertised on TV, then bought it for our elementary school library. This is an excellent video, with accuracy in both script and physical setting.

This is the second Pulsar I have own. The first has served me well as a dress watch for over 25 years. When I went looking for a replacement for my 20 year old casio G-Shock I wanted a better look and found it here without sacraficing features. This is a great value for the money. It functions as advertised and looks good too.,1
"I bought this card for two reasons:1. It supposedly has excellent Linux support, at least as of Ubuntu 10.10.2. I was using a tiny little USB wifi adapter through 1 story of my house and a couple walls. I thought I could increase my network performance.I never tried #1 because I booted into Windows 7 first. #2 was a complete failure. The signal quality on this is simply AWFUL. It's not the antenna either -- I tried an enormous antenna on it (over a foot long) without much improvement.As a test, I tried my $10 USB wifi adapter alongside this TrendNet unit. The tiny cheap USB adapter was far better. I lost about 60% of my packets with the Trendnet. I lost *none* with the USB adapter, though latency would sometimes increase from <1ms to double digits.Bottom line is my little USB ""Azio AWU101N"" which I got for under $10 was better in every single way. Avoid this card.",0
"Gomorrah came highly recommended, but honestly, I just don't see why. The movie was disjointed and aimless, trying to act like a pseudo-documentary while following around five different people and showing how the organized crime syndicate affects their lives, or defines their lives. Actually quite boring, tedious, dull. The director never allows us to ""connect"" with the main characters, so ultimately, we don't care about them. Just random, strung-together scenes.

"All in all this is a great frother. It does what it is supposed to do. The only problem is that when you heat the milk on the stove top the handle get hot as well. Other than that I haven't found a frother that works better than this one, and I have tried a plethora of them.",1
"This is a wonderful chair. Very comfortable and glides easily. I put it together by myself in 30 minutes. (I really wanted to try it out before my husband got home!) All pieces were accounted for and nothing was broken (a complaint of some reviewers). As another reviewer said, I did have to look at the picture on Amazon to put the arm cushions on accurately since it wasn't part of the instructions. But after looking at the picture, it was easy. It does lock into a reclining position also. (One reviewer said it didn't recline.)The chair is very comfortable for me and my husband (we're both under 180 lbs), but if you need extra room, it might be a little snug. Dutalier chairs seemed to be wider when we were testing them in the store but they are much more expensive.",1

"I expected this book to be dense and incomprehensible, like I have found other of their books before, but the material is actually clearly presented, and not as terse as it may seem from a first glance. While not as comprehensive in coverage as Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, I find it easier to follow. As far as coverage of GR goes, it's succinct: I found it very helpful to work through this book before tackling MTW.",1
"The only ""holes"" in the red tank are the filler hole and the assembly containing the gas line nipple. That assembly, a large square plastic base with hole for the gasline nipple, is connected to the tank with 4 screws. After first fill-up, the tank leaked extensively where that assembly is connected to the tank with the 4 screws. I'll attempt to tighten the screws, but they're not slotted or Phillips. Maybe I can un-screw it and apply some caulking and then re-attach it.",0

"This is a true story of singer, Lillian Roth, her sinking into alcoholism, her abusive relationships with men, her hitting bottom and then recovery via. Alcoholica Anonymous.Susan Hayward is magnificent in the title roll as well as the other performers. This is also an introduction to Alcoholics Anonymous, a 12-step program, and the price it takes to get ""sober.""I enjoyed the film because of the honesty, the acting, and the music score. Everyone can relate to this story.",1
"Our 20-month old son loves this book and it's one of his most requested books when he sits down on the potty. He enjoys pointing out familiar items in the pictures and answers the questions posed in the text. I like the simplicity of the language used and that when I read it, I don't need to change any of the words. I also like that the book is gender-neutral, and that the language used is on the child's level- not talking at or down to them, but more with them. Definitely recommend this book.",1
"I also experienced the problem that two other reveiwers of this product did. Namely, my screen would flash on and off. I tried replacing the batteries and that didn't work. Finally in desperation I turned the device on and pressed the menu button several times in a row. This fixed the problem and I haven't experienced it since! The sound quality on this prodcut is good. With the volume being (for me anyway) more than loud enough. The radio and voice recording are both decent. Overall this was a very good buy for the money.",1
"Using this in a Bible study and find it very relevant. Bought two more copies for elderly friends questioning their ""present"". Elizabeth George has a knack for saying what you need to hear.",1
"I recently rented this video, and I was disappointed. The effects are generally really good, but there is such a clear influence of Anime on this film, as well as cheap TV shows like Power Rangers. For example, there are many scenes in which the monsters are running, and it looks like the stuff came right out of a Power Rangers battle. Likewise, the music is very ""modern"" -- lots of electric guitar -- rather than a more traditional Godzilla score. Worst of all, the human ""mutants"" are very much stylized to look like Anime characters, right down to their hair styles. It was cool to see a few of the monsters in action again, but overall I didn't think this film did them justice.",0
The product arrived quickly and was exactly as shown - works great and a good price! I would recommend it to anyone.,1
It worked good for support in the baby tub when I had to sponge bathe her. Other then that I dont see too many uses for it. I only used it twice and now it reaks of mildew. I made sure to ring it after every use and hang it. I just hope they will still let me return it.,0
This product is poorly made. The rubber suction cup separated from the base the first time it was used and cannot be reattached. This is not same quality as the original windshield mount that came with the Garmin.,0

"The aluminum cap is very thin. The material bends VERY easily. The Pilot light system is not reliable. This unit is VERY hard to light even on a zero wind (calm day). The flame adjustment knob movement is cheap. Not solid feel. Would not buy again, and if someone would give me my money back I'd be so pleased. VERY disappointed.",0
"If you want one book to do it all, get this one.At least it provides you with a vision of most of the issues surrounding infertility.It provides excellent information on female infertility issues.It provides cursory information about male infertility issues.We have recommended and loaned out this book to several friends, and they all were happy with the details provided.",1
"I bought the product last month, after two weeks of use one of the rubber pads sheared and now the knife is no longer held in place. It would be an, at least, four star review however if the company, Victorinox, would have included extra rubber grommets, offered to ship me out a couple extra, or even sold the rubber grommets separately, which they would not do without replacing the product.",0
Finally some music my husband can listen too along with the kids. This is a great CD!,1
"This book is a must have if you're traveling through New England. One of the best features is suggested itineraries if you're at a loss where the best spots are to hit and how to get to them in the time frame you're visiting whether that would be one, two weeks or something else. Love the information on lodging. The book breaks it down from very expensive to economical and suggests such things like staying on the north side of a hotel because the south side is facing a high traffic street. This is my second Frommers book. The first I used was in Ireland and the book was with me all the time and we didn't have any trouble finding our way around to sites we wanted to visit. I highly recommend this book!",1
"I purchased this after reading the very positive reviews. I'm very unsure what all of the 5 stars are all about. This is your standard cheap plastic floater with very little control of chlorine flow and shallow bay for tabs. I tried to fit six tabs inside every which way with no success. Short of breaking them up into bits, you can fit only 4 tabs. Spend the extra 5 bucks and get a better product.",0
"My four year old loves Barbie! The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five is because my daughter does not ask to watch it very often. She enjoys this movie, but it is not one of her favorites. There are no scary parts in this movie.",1

"I bought these headphones because I needed something for working out with that wouldn't fall out of my ears. My wife didn't want me to buy them because of the price. After several work out sessions I can say they are quite comfortable and never feel like they are going to fall off while I'm running. The sound is as good as a more expensive pair of Shure in ears that I own. I think at this price point it would be hard to find a better sounding pair of headphones. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is I would like to see a bit better cable on them. It seems a bit thin. But, at this price point I can't really complain. Oh, and my wife that didn't want me to spend this much money on a pair of headphones to work out in now wants a pair for herself :)",1

"As other reviewers have indicated, this is not the place for the casual Jeff Buckley fan. The man obviously had talent, but too often over these two discs he seems to be playing strictly for himself. I am reminded of many nights jamming in a friend's basement where songs would often last ten minutes or more. Sometimes we would be brilliant, most times we were much less than that. While this was fun for us, it made our girlfriends run for the hills. Now I know how they felt.",0
"i have read dozens of romance books, this one by far depicts the love between a man and woman more beautifully, pure, sweet, and simply wonderful than any other. THe way she ( the author) describes the herione and hero's feeling for each other is just wonderful. It makes you yearn for the ove this two share, and you fall in love with the characters, the setting, everything. Buy this book.",1
"Boy, are you dumb. My brother got this and he hated it so he gave it to me. I hate it too. I think that I'm going to burn it. You know, putting CD's in the microwave is really cool. This album definitely deserves a place in there with all of the America Online discs that we get all of the time...AVOID THIS. Trust me.",0
"I really enjoyed this book. I must admit that I'm a little too drawn out with the topic of sports. Yet while reading this novel I was just re-immersed with feelings of high school/ middle school days when I was in sports. This novel is just THAT good. The context is compelling. The writing is even far more impressive than what I had anticipated. Overall, this was a really great book.",1
"Wow -- after all the great reviews here i thought i would give julie garwood a try. to my deep disappointment, she is dreadful. her dialogue is utterly stupid, her plot is nonsensical, and her characters are one-dimensional at best. what a waste of time. and just think of all the poor trees used to make this trash. horrid!",0
I liked features and size of the product so decided to give it a try despite ~50-50 review here. Player got stuck and started to show broken images in half-an-hour!! I tried second one assuming first one was bad piece... but same problem!! How consistent!!! I have strong feeling that you are really lucky if it worked for you. I have chosen 1 star because that's the least choice available.,0
"My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.",0
"I vaguely remember Will Lee as being a man of moral virtue in Grass Roots (my favorite Stuart Woods book). He now returns as a man running for President. Unusual circumstances cause him to run before he is ready. Lee maintains his integrity throughout the campaign. There are many plot twists, assassination attempts, and a past love encounter to hold one's interest. Woods includes characters from some of his other books, but he does not feel the need to characterize them in depth. Surprises abound. They made this a good read.",1
"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 DIXIE CHICKS VOLUME 3 Karaoke CD&G CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS PRO SOUND COUNTRY collection (1502G), This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations.",1
"i bought this for my son so that he would have more options on his videonow.well the media wizard is awful!!!!!!!when i tried to burn onto a pvd disk(it comes with 4) i got a ongoing pop up screen saying that there was a problem with the disk.once you try to burn something and you get a ""problem with the disk"" error,the disk is ruined.i have gone through 2 sets of these.!!!!!!!In my opinion they are not the worth the time and effort and i know it will cost more money in the long run to buy the regular videonow disks but are worth it.I do not like the media wizard,just awful.save your money on this one!",0
"Granted, this wasn't a big budget picture, but I'm surprised that a couple of high school sophomores could come up with enough money to make this film. If you like attractive actors, poor writing, poor acting, the best special effects of the sixties, and an occasional glimpse of the boom mic, then this movie is for you. If you like to know that you've spent your money and time on something worthwhile, keep on looking!",0
"I have a very light weight camera, a Panasonic Lumix, but I wanted a rock solid tripod that wouldn't cost me more than the camera, for taking videos and stills, especially at lower shutter speeds. I have found it to be rock solid, very quick to setup and adjust and put away. It has some very nice features, like quick snap locks for the leg extensions, a solid base, a level bubble incorporated into the tripod, it locks quickly on all the axes, and has a removable plate that screws into the camera tripod screw socket so the camera can be attached to or removed from the tripod instantly. I am extremely pleased with this tripod. I couldn't be happier.",1
I wish aliens would come down and take the Strause brothers away so they can't make any more bad movies.,0
"The longest movie I have seen, even though it lasted only 93 minutes. A lousy clunker in every way. Why do people tolerate such awful movies just because they are gay? The plot, the script, the acting, and practically every aspect of the movie are as bad as I have seen in recent years. I also find the broad brushstrokes the movie uses to paint every single man in it as a flighty, silly, sex-crazed creature of the old stereotype extremely offensive.",0
"I thought this book was the best ever explanation about why gum care and oral hygeine in general is so important to overall health. Dr. Bonner uses easy understood language that an non-medical person can feel comfortable reading it. I now recommend this book to all my clients and friends as a ""must read""!",1
"Aside from this book being repetitive, simplistic, and hardly connected, Murphy cites facts and uses sources that are far from relevant. He quotes actor Steven Seagal on Japanese culture, he refers to the T.V. show X-files on numerous occasions, and explains the significance of playing bagpipes at funerals. The most irritating part of this book, however, was Murphy's constant commercials. On almost every page he seems to be convincing the readers to buy t-shirts online, to watch certain movies, or to join the SWAT team (which I can only assume has been one of the authors life-long dreams.) If you are considering reading the book, please use your time more resourcefully.",0
"I enjoy Desi Arnaz's music, and I adore I Love Lucy. But this CD is really not that interesting except as a novelty or as TV memorabilia. What proves interesting or funny in the show is a bit annoying when just heard on disc.",0
"I bought the pump at the suggestion of your many accolades to the ISIS pump, it was pretty, but it only last me about a month...The Plastic crumbled and the pump died...I was in the middle of pumping and the chassis of the thing just fell off. I bought another one, and the same thing happened. Was i too hard on the thing? The worst part is that you can only use AVENT Bottles to pump into, if there is an adapter they don't sell them where I have looked for them...I really hate this thing, it would have been nice if it would not have fell apart...the design is pretty to a fault.In any ""avent"" I am not discouraged...I am now using the Evenflow Electric Pump to my wonderful Baby Girl's delight!",0
"The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea! What the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on BD when the movie itself is such a great one? Unbelievable! A movie like this should have a flawless transfer! Argh!",0
Just when you think that american pop rock can't get any slower...Think Joy Division on an american diet of fluff and shallowness. The vocalist tries his best to be Ian Curtis but the atmosphere and the intensity isn't there. Lyrically this album borders on emo because all they're doing is whining about women being mean. Aww.. naughty women were mean to these two fugs.In short.. this band is great for those who need things to be spelled out for them. Which makes it perfect for American teenagers :D.,0
"I love Matthew Perry, but he needs someone to help him pick better films. I like films about dysfunctional families, but this movie was a sub-par example of the genre. This movie had the elements of a promising film but the content of the scenes was not clever, humorous, or perceptive enough. (Though there is one scene that sticks in my memory involving smoking marijuana that I thought was authentic/original/cool.)Instead of this, if you haven't seen it, see The Safety of Objects, a film that my subconscious keeps returning to months after seeing it.",0
"This movie is pretty brutal. Irritating characters talk to the camera and tell you the laws of dating as if they could maintain a relationship for more than Mardi Gras weekend. At one point a character says ""Sex without love equals violence."" No, this movie without alcohol equals violence.A group of guys including Jerry O'Connell (I liked him better when he was the fat kid), head out to hook-up with some fly honeys, yo. But that's all whack, yo. Ahem. Obnoxious, isn't it. Jerry goes home with Tara Reid and they have sex. Or was it [violation]? There is a lot of other sex, but the story seems to focus...actually it doesn't focus at all. It's just a series of vignettes. ... I like Tara Reid when she's herself, but she's played so many unlikable characters I'm beginning dislike her. Ditto for Amanda Peet.Highest recommendation to avoid. If you need dating tips, try [someone else].",0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!,0
The Ironmaster Super Bench is terrific for the price. I would buy it again. Easy to assemble and easy to use. Durable and comfortable. The only opportunity for improvement with this bench would be if it had wheels to make moving it around my carpet easier.,1
"I was disappointed with this book. Although it was printed in 2003, it contains many of the same inaccuracies from books printed 30 to 40 years ago. For example, the book says that Yorktown staged four air attacks on Tulagi. Actually, it was only three. The books says that B-26 bombers attacked Crace's convoy. Actually, it was three B-17s. The book says that the Japanese lost a light cruiser. The Japanese lost no cruisers in or around this battle. I could list more. Henry's book does contain a lot of nice pictures, but most of those pictures are now available on the Internet anyway. To anyone looking for a more up to date and accurate book on the battle I would suggest John Lundstrom's ""Black Shoe Carrier Admiral"".",0
"THESE NOTEBOOKS ARE WELL MADE. I PURCHASED THEM FOR WORKING ON A MEDICAL FILE AND EACH NOTEBOOK WAS FOR A DIFFERENT DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL.TOPS Spiral Steno Books, 6 x 9 Inches, Gregg Rule, Greentint Paper, 70 Sheets per Book, 12 Books per Pack (8011)",1
"Well, I loved this DVD. From ""Layla"" (which, might I add, is not predictable, seeing as how it's the first time he's played the Derek and the Dominos version of the song in who knows how long) to ""River of Tears"", this is a great concert. The guest artists are excellent. Sheryl Crow and Clapton sound wonderful together, and I was glad to see her there. Mary J. Blige... I don't know, if it suits your fancy... and Bob Dylan was excellent if you like Bob Dylan, as I do. David Sanborn, one of the best rock saxophone players today, is an excellent addition to the house band, which includes standards like Nathan East, Steve Gadd, Andy Fairweather-Low, Tessa Niles, and Katie Kissoon, plus Tim Carmon, a great keyboard player who makes his keyboard solo sound like a guitar solo in ""Old Love"", and Dave Delhomme, who just sits and plays keyboards. Great companion to ""Live in Hyde Park"".",1
"The score has some moment which led you to the road of excitment, enjoyment and imagination. This is an above average soundtrack. When you listen to the soundtrack, you will remember the scenario of the film.",1
"I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book. The first page of the book is page 16, and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author's note printed throughout this section. The rest of the book appears okay, though.",0
"THIS IS THE STORY OF ONE OF THE GREATEST PITCHERS AND MOST COLORFUL CHARACTERS TO EVER PUT ON A UNIFORM. DIZZY DEAN WAS A SIMPLE COUNTRY BOY WHO MADE GREAT HEADLINES WITH HIS MOUTH AND HIS GREAT PITCHING ARM. DIZ WAS VERY COCKY, BRASH, AND OUTSPOKEN ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER PAUL'S ABILITIES. A VERY COLORFUL AND HUMOROUS CHARACTER. AFTER HIS CAREER ENDED WAY BEFORE IT SHOULD HAVE, DIZ BECAME A VERY POPULAR BROADCASTER WHO LET HIS NATURAL, COUNTRY, HUMOROUS STYLE BECOME HIS TRADEMARK AS ONE OF GREATS ON TV AND RADIO. A VERY INTERESTING BOOK ABOUT BOTH DIZ AND BASEBALL IN GENERAL DURING THE DEPRESSION. VERY RECOMMENDED.",1
"While in general terms, junk food is obviously bad for you, I found this document somewhat misleading, mainly because the reporter went on a 30-day diet of only McDonald's products for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Throughout this time, he always oversized, overate and of course, he fell sick.The average person who eats at fast food restaurants don't do so every day, nor do they eat such exhorbitant amounts at once.This whole thing was a gross exaggeration.",0
"I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE. I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER, ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE. THEY WERE 17.99+4.59 SHIPPING. HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER. THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE, HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL, AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING. ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE. THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS. WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME. I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL. WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN, OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM .",0

"This is a fantastic tool to use if you're trying to move into Spanish fluency from, say, an ""I took four years in school but can't speak in sentences"" stage. The stories are great and interesting enough to listen to more than once. The CD in the back of the book allows you to listen while reading along, which helps immensely. I haven't found another book like it.",1
"After seeing the movie, I was enchanted by the images and sounds of the film for days. When I dicovered there was a score, I was frantic to buy it. Without a doubt, this is the most powerful CD in my collection. The tunes, though short, can greatly influence your mood. Listening to Track 1, ""Still Dead,"" can get you in an uplifting spirit; Track 2, ""Arose,"" will cause you to dream of private fantasies. The most powerful songs, Track 8 and 18, titled ""American Beauty/Still Dead,"" can bring tears to your eyes. The melancholy piano of those songs will bring you down into the greyest depression you've ever experienced, which is good every one in a while. If you loved the movie, or just liked it, get the CD. Images of the film will keep coming back to you as you listen.",1
"It really looks like a B movie. They don't make Halloween, scary movies like the used to. I wanted more dialogue, and better photography.",0
"Well, I got one year of use out of it before it broke, predictably, right where everyone else's broke. I won't buy another, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're OK with your $90 purchase being junk after one year - probably less than 200 uses. Seems it could be built better.",0
"I got myself this collection since pink panther was one of my fav. cartoons as a kid and i still love it as an adult just as much.The reason i gave it a one star is because of the bad packaging , almost all dvds were scratched and one of them was scratched like nothing ive ever seen before, it wouldnt even start...Thats about it i guess , one of the best things ever wasted by bad packaging.",0
"Yes,I agree,the material is not as good as in her previous albums.Only few tracks stand out : 'Oooh Boy','From Now on',Johnny's back','Don't Wanna Go Home','Someone Who Needs Me'.Nevertheless, this recording has brought Regina's reputation even much further with her striking yet soothing vocals.No doubt,this CD is her bestseller and her most enduring on every Soul/Jazz playlist, in every corner of the planet.THIS IS REGINA is a showcase for her ability with a ballad,in a style that very much reminds you of an intimate performance in an after-hours night club.",1
"I think XTC is the most underrated pop band of the 80's. The fact everything this band did seems to be completely ignored on radio airwaves, despite being consistently enjoyable time and time again only shows how sad and lonely this world can be. This is probably their biggest album, but make sure you buy everything the band released before this one for a really enjoyable pop experience. If you're not satisfied, well, that just can't be possible now, can it?",1
"The diaper champed worked well for 4 months. Once we introduced cereal to our baby, the diaper smelled stronger. The champ did not stay 'odorless' as they state. I have heard from other parents who have experienced the same issue. The baby's room had an odor as soon as you walked in. This is after we scrubbed it down.",0
"This lens is fantastic! It's a good zoom lens, and a good macro lens. If you need one that will carry you through the day and will take all kinds of pictures, this is the right one. A con of this lens is its weight. Since it is glass, it weights a lot for a lens, and that can get even heavier over a long day. I suggest buying a small backpack to keep your camera in if you are going to use it over a long day. All in all, I am very happy and highly recommend this lens!",1
"Great sounding speakers, they look good too and they were delivered nice and fast.I really am happy - to the point where I purchased some more for inside the boat :)The only thing I would like to point out is that after having them fitted in my cockpit for a while I noticed that the screws had started to rust - slightly disappointed that they werent stainless considering the main use of these as marine speakers.Still, a quick trip to the hardware store and less than 2 dollars later I had 8 stainless steel screwsSo, buy them for sure but change the screws out with stainless :)",1

"Best Snakeboots you can own! When the Jackel snakeboot was discontinued, this was Danners only other choice. The Jackel is back now and is on order!! The Pronghorn is much more of a working boot, where as the Jacket is more of a hunting/stalking kind of boot. Lighter and more flexible than the Pronghorn. The Pronghorn is also an inch taller, which gives a little bit more secure feeling out in the marsh and saltgrass. Love them both!",1

"First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my ""read again"" books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!",1
"I purchased this book to help study for the math portion of the PPST. I studied using the drills and when I took the test I found that the math portion was mostly story problems, NOT drills. In fact there were no similar questions on the test compared to the book. I took the test in Jan 2002. Don't waste your money on this. There is an excellent book put out by ETS called Learning Plus Mathematics. This book is very realistic as far as what is included and is quite similar to the test.",0
"I've never had a baby but I have had 2 accidents which left me injured and out of shape almost 2 years later. As a former advocate of Step (Cher's 'A New Attitude') workouts and Cindy's last workout tape, 'The Next Challenge', I needed a program which would help me build up strength in my body *and* get back into shape.This tape has a really good learning curve and is especially good for anyone who hasn't worked out in a while. It really encouraged me to see that Cindy seemed to get tired out too. I have to admit that I skipped the push-ups (never could do those!) as they were too hard for me but it's good to have something I can grow into.This workout is definitely not just for women who have just had a baby! My gripe? Why no DVD release?",1
"Wonderful information for children, it really puts their mind at ease about the death of their beloved pet. Though directed at an age group over five, parents can change some words but the pictures are vibrant and playful and leave a good mental image.",1
"""It's A Long Way To The Top..."" (dig the bagpipe solo) and ""High Voltage"" are the two first rate songs on this album, the rest are just okay, or rather non-descript.

"I have this 7.5kW heater mounted in the corner of my 24 x 28 storey and a half garage. The internal fan circulates the heat across the 28 feet adequately. I have it set to heat the garage to 5 deg Celsius and It runs maybe 10 mins maximum per hour in -25 deg ambient temperatures. It is small, mounts with very little clearance needed and is very quiet having zero vibrations.I think it's well made and works well!",1
"A strange story with a plot that I couldn't really follow. There were stories from other people's POV and you can't tell if it's from a vampire or a human. And the book starts to look good when Akasha finally makes her appearance to the coven but in like two paragraphs, she dies at random when Mekare comes. The whole time, they were afraid of her and her all-powerfulness and some random vampire comes and kills her? That just makes the whole thing, well, pointless. It's an okay book because there wer some parts I did like but it really didn't make any sense.",0
"This book was selected by my book club, not by me. I enjoyed the author's descriptions and the plot was interesting but not compelling.",0
"Nothing more than a creative, but mostly deceptive exploitation of mankind's morbid curiosity of death and mutilation. Although the special effects were decent, most of the scenes were re-created. (For those of you who still believe it's real, read the ending credits.) Most decent Americans should find this movie repulsive in the least and is better suited for today's de-sensitized blood-&-guts galore adolecents than for mainstream horror fans. This movie does however take the credit for spawning the seemingly endless supply of actual death depicting videos and ""shocumentry"" TV shows. See FOD if only to say you saw it, but try ""Traces Of Death"" if you crave REAL footage of death, destuction, mutilation and mayhem.",0
"This book is a fictionalized account of the torture murder of Sylvia Likens in 1965 Indianapolis. It represents the author's attempt to cash in on a horrible tragedy. I would recommend reading ""House of Evil"" by John Dean instead. Dean's book is an account of the actual case, not an exploitative work of fiction that adds made-up methods of torture that are even sicker than the ones carried out by the depraved group who actually committed this horrible crime. If you want to read good horror, check out Bentley Little, who has enough of an imagination that he doesn't have to draw on real-life tragedies to make a buck.",0
"Ja Rule is an amazing rapper. He is a better rapper than DMX. He has great beats and incredible lyrics. Suicide Freestyle is one of the best rap songs I've ever heard in my life. I would love for it to be longer. Almost every song is great. All are good. We Here Now, Holla Holla, Suicide Freestyle, Story To Tell, and Race against Time are all amazing songs. He has tight beats, which is surprising, because Swizz hasn't consistently made great beats since DMX's first album. Not only are Ja's lyrics great, but he has such a great rap voice, and can rap extremely fast and still be smooth and understandable. Buy this C.D. After a few listens, you will love it.",1
"I love movies. I love war movies, especially. I am sorry to whoever came up with this movie but it shouldn't even be called a movie. Everything from the acting to the plot is terrible. Not even close to being OK and to think I payed to watch 45 minutes of it. I think I am more frustrated that I wasted my time. Seriously, no matter how desperate you are for a war movie don't watch this one.",0
"This is a very basic review of investing for only the least informed. At the same time those with limited knowledge will find it hard to read. It lacks detail and as a result, lacks in-depth explanations that could clarify many of the areas that are covered. Specifically the section on Options trading was very poor. There are few ""teaching"" moments that you would expect to find in a ""Guidebook"".",0
"I bought this product expecting it to do what i needed done and it worked the first time i pressed the button and the range was about one hundred yards but then when i continued to use this product throughout the week i noticed the range getting smaller and smaller, then my dog figured out if she can get away from me as fast as she can she can run get out of the range of the collar and get away. I was very displeased with this product because at the end of the first week i bought it the range was down to about ten yards. Also this collar goes through batteries like crazy. I bough twenty-five batteries to go with it and within three weeks i had to order another twenty- five batteries and trust me these batteries are quite expensive.",0
"This phone has many features that I really wanted--ability to add addition hands sets, shared phonebook, speakerphone on each handset, 5.8 Ghz DSS. I didn't find any other phone w/ these features even though, to me, they seem like minimal features in a modern phone. Anyway, I am really disappointed. Each feature is poorly executed such that it is really a pretty lousy phone. The shared phonebook is a nice idea but so hard to access and find the number that its really quicker to dial the number yourself. The voicequality of the handsets is inferior to every other phone I've used. The only (sorta) exception is that the handset speakerphone voicequality is even worse. 5.8 DSS is nice, but the range is short (doesn't reach out to my driveway even though my baby monitor works fine in that location). I recommend that you not buy this phone. Wait till another company implements this feature set in a better phone.",0

"I purchased the first 3 seasons and it is in season 3 that the initial coolness of Miami Vice starts to slip. I am toying with just getting the last years of the series to complete the set, but the hard, unapproachable, mystery of the Miami Vice characters is changing in season 3. Maybe I am too hard, but season 1 and 2 seem a little truer to form.",1

"To start, when this phone system works properly, it is very nice. The sound quality is fine, ergonomics are good, and there are plenty of features. To set up the phone properly and utilize all of the features it takes someone not intimidated by technology.Unfortunately after 12 months ownership, both of the handsets failed. The keypads stopped working so you could not dial out or hang up. Out of warranty I replaced them with two new handsets. 6 months later the base failed. When I called Siemens customer support to ask for help, they claimed a failure rate of < 1%. Of course, being out of warranty, they wouldn't consider replacing the base. On my original purchase the Siemens product failure rate is now 100%.",0
"Following on the heels of Slanted, Westing features a lot of music recorded before the first album and, as such, is a window into the world of VERY early Pavement. Lo-fi, noisy, and a bit all-over-the-place, you'll find tiny track after tiny track of off-the-wall parodies on this-and-that with the kitchen sink thrown in and busted up for good measure. Everything seems to have been disgorged without much revision, which is a plus and a minus, depending on your tastes. Anyone who REALLY follows Pavement should own this... it's roots, baby.",1
"I like the novel. The movie is true to a story and is an interesting story about a completely different world with their own lives, traumas and suffering.",1

I am a size 10-12 depending on the product and I ordered a Large which is 12-14 and I couldn't even get it past my arm pits, it seemed more of a size 9-10 than a 12-14. It also comes with a headband (with no feather) which I didn't think it did but it is really big and I would need to take it in an inch or so to make it fit.",0
This book has too many scenarios and not enough information from the writer re: factual information that would have been useful.,0
I am a young carpenter but I have been doing this kind of work since I was a child. My father owned a construction business so I didn't have summer vacation. I built houses. Now I own the business and 10's of thousands of dollars in the best tools. I have had this table for 1.5 years and it is a horrible thing for precision. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought one. Everything written about this thing is true. The fence is nice but thats it. You have to take the thing apart to change bits. The table sags real bad and is hard to drill out for your router. I had to use my drill press to do it and counter sink the screws as well. You have to take it apart to store it or it will not fold up and the laminate fence pieces are curved. I just use it now with a cheap router to do stuff that doesn't matter much.,0

"This is a great game, but the complaint I have are the space battles. Why can't be like the original Battlefront where there is no boost or those hard to destroy turrets! Or the fighters can be faster without the boost, so overall its just fast, but can make it slow! Rise of the Empire is a little hard. I'm on the Polis Massa level, but I almost beat the level(I only had one more Objective left!)Then my reinforcement force count depleted! I wish instead of restarting the level, you can restart teh objective. I heard that the Jedi can block rifle fire but I can't find the block button! Where is it! Can the next reviewer tell me!",1

It was strange that I didn't loose weight because I greatly reduced my caloric intake and it is generally very easy for me to loose a couple of pounds when I need to. One night, out of the blue, I had a severe panic attack. I believe it to be caused by the SlimQuick Extreme so I stopped taking it immediately and all symptoms went away. Then my weight ballooned by 10 lbs. over the next month. My eating habits were very normal and healthy (vegetarian, tons of vegetables and fruit, almost no fat) but Slimquick destroyed my metabolism.

"The phone is ok, nothing more. The reception from outside callers is fine, but when I talk, my own voice in the earpiece has significant static--it's pretty annoying!The phone is heavier then I thought it would be (Maybe all 900MHZ phone are, my old cordless was analog) and it's not very comfortable when holding it with your shoulder and no hands.I live in a relatively small apartment and was surprised that when I went to another room (maybe 50 feet away) the calls would cut out! And this is why a bought a 900 mhz digital phone!Finally, a complaint would be the apparent inability to program the numbers into memory alphanumerically. In other words, I have to scan through a list of phone numbers, instead of seeing, ""Mom and Dad"", ""Office"", etc.I probably would have sent it back, but unfortunately, I tossed the box, so I guess I'll live with it.",0
I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Good performances by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast. Many times when working with child actors it can make or break a film. I am happy to say it was an asset to this movie. Solid directon and writing should also be noted here. The movie had nice pacing and didn't drag much at all. A great movie suspends the disbelief of the audience. This movie made you feel like you were part of the magic of the making of Peter Pan. Highly recommended.,1
"This video is outdated. I didn't notice the date when I bought it, but after playing it, I looked it up and found it was produced in 1996! So, the latest dance moves are not in this dvd. Some kids won't notice that, but the savvy ones sure will! It is definitely hard to follow, especially as the dancers are facing the viewers, making it harder to copy what they are doing with their feet.",0
"Rented this DVD and then bought it based on Peter Gabriel's performance of ""In Your Eyes"". Unbelievable performance, and I wasn't a PG fan until then. Bruce is great and many others!",1
"Some wit once said the Black Sabbath has endured more facelifts than some Hollywood stars. This album is one of the finest examples of why Black Sabbath became a parody. Eternal Idol went through 3 producers,3 singers, 2 bass players and 2 drummers. Tony Iommi being the only stability.Tony Martin finally took over as vocalist. No one can dispute his singing ablities, but it's hard to appreciate them on this album. How a group that has produced such classics as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Volume 4 and Heaven And Hell offer such a sub standard albumIt is lightweight, samey and boring. I find it hard to tell one song from the other. It actually starts of quite well with The Shining, but it is seriously downhill from there.I really advise you not to waste your money.",0
"It was Child's Play 2 that started my love for horror movies. It was on tv when I was about 6 years old, and I loved it! I still love it. It's been two years since Andy Barclay has been rid of Chucky, but the greedy people at Play Pals Toy Company resurrects the original Chucky doll, and brings Chucky back to life. Andy has been placed in the foster care of Phil and Joanne Simpson because his mom has gone crazy. Chucky finds Andy and the nightmare begins again. Andy made friends with the teenage girl that the Simpsons are also looking after. Her name is Kyle, and she is HOT! Soon, Kyle believes Andy about Chucky and she tries to help him. They eventually have an ulimate showdown at the Play Pals Toy Company. If you love horror and Chucky, you'll love CHILD'S PLAY 2!!!",1
"From reading others' reviews I can tell that the character of Stephanie Plum is appealing to some; unfortunately, she was more appaling to me. Stephanie never manages to grab my sympathy, and being forced to read descriptions of a rapist's work without ever getting good development of the plot makes this book a disappointment. Too bad, from everyone else's reviews, I thought I'd really enjoy this. Needless to say, there are much better books out there, and I won't be reading the rest of this series!",0

"I'm sorry, but I don't think that this should be in the genera of horror because it fundamentally consists of a man having sex with a ""mentally challenged"" girl. The plot makes little sense and there are no unexpected twists in the movie what so ever, with the exception of a man (who seems to be an upstanding citizen) having sex with a mentally disabled girl. The movie was a waste of my time and should be locked away in a vault to be burned at a later date. My Younger sister decided she wanted a little scare and borrowed this movie, now we joke about how ridiculous this disturbing movie was. Anyone who truly likes this movie should think long and hard about what this story would be like in real life (the rape and capture of a young womanwith extreme mental problems).I watched it once and will never forget how this is the worst movie i've ever seen",0
"here we have cher's latest opus--ten tracks of flavorless porno movie background music that would have been laughed off the charts if it had come from just about anyone else. cher's singing remains as hopeless as it always has been--as resonant as cardboard and so tuneless that she might as well be rapping. in someone else's hands the retro chic 70s disco stylings of this disc might have provided some interesting contrapuntal commentary on 90s techno innovations, but cher just doesn't have artistic acumen to make that lead balloon rise even one inch off the ground. some of this stuff is danceable, but so is a k-mart drum machine, which is just about as interesting. from her start in the 3rd rate lounge act, ceasar and cleo, through sonny and cher, greg allman, films and infomercials, cher has waged a relentless, one woman war against the taste and mind of america, proving time and again that p.t. barnum was a genius and a visionary.",0

I had a very hard time even making it through this movie. It took me a couple of days because I couldn't take it all at once. This movie is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. And I have a collection of well over a thousand horror films. The acting is bad. The story is bad the characters are bad. It seems like the movie makers were counting on the nudity and lesbian action to make this film work. I would most definitely rather have a good story which this film does not have. Do not waste your time or money. I even enjoy bad B horror films quite a lot. This can't even compare to those. I'm putting up my copy of this movie for sale on an internet auction site right away!,0
"Please Do NOT Buy the Passport Edition for the following reasons:I received the item and I could already hear the item shaking around in the case unopened. The Case looks like a normal high quality but as soon as you open it you will discover it is not. Packaging is everything. The DVD comes pre-scratched in a condition that I have to beg my player to accept it. Maybe these scratches account for the low quality of the transfer, But I do not believe they do. Also, passport gives you a fine view of their logo for the entire duration of the film. I've had DVDs for close to ten years and my oldest ones aren't scratched as bad as this one. By the way, it smells horrible. Yes, this dvd literally stinks. I don't even have to review the movie because if you order this DVD, you'll never watch the movie as it stands.",0
"This one of those religious films that can also be classified as fantasy because of the myths that are included in it. Overall, it is a good film but I would have liked it to be a bit more of a drama. Bergen and McDowell are fine in their roles as the title saint and his nemesis in the Catholic Church. The film does reverberate with everything that is Irish, the beautiful landscape, the spirited people, the emotionally-charged and angelic Celtic music and the rich culture that is Ireland.",1
"This stuff isn't bad at all. It has a very nice, refreshing taste and although it has a bit of sugar in it, it doesn't have as mcuh as most sodas and has potassium in it. I'd definitely buy it again.",1
"You would think that with an item that required assembly, the manufacturer would at least make sure it can be assembled. The simple effort of screwing on 4 legs to a fireplace grate cannot be done if the leg screw holes are grossly oversized and NOT THREADED.

I hope Ace Hardware Outlet items can be returned directly to the store.Thanks and remember, Buyer Beware.",0
"This little gem was on display next to a Kitchen Aid chopper - I bought the Kitchen Aid, took it home - it failed to work. Went back for the Black & Decker.

"Although Clooney is a liberal I give him credit for--wisely, in my opinion--making this the very cynical tale of a Democratic political race. Otherwise the film could and would have been panned as a political hit job. By making it the twisted tale of a Democratic race he keeps the attention where it belongs i.e. on the cynicism and corruption inherent in the political system.On the other hand, the above is something of a cliche. Virtually all of us non-politicians have contempt for the political system and for politicians--unless, of course, they're the politicians that we intend to vote for. Therefore, I must agree with a previous reviewer that this movie--although entertaining and well acted--uncovers no new ground. It confirms our prejudices and one things that prejudices don't need is reconfirmation.I must say, however, that I liked some of the details of the movie. The male main character of the movie--time and again--shocks us with his greed and overwhelming ambition.",1

"I purchased this cookbook and it is by far the smartest format that I've ever seen. I find it difficult to find the time to write a weekly menu, shop and cook daily. The book is arranged by season, and broken down into weekly menues AND shopping lists. So far I've completed 2 weeks of menues and they've been delicious. I have shared the meals with 3 other adults and all the recipes have been rated based on whether they'd like to have them again in the future. I am happy to say the recipes got 3 out of 4 thumbs up, and 4 out of 4 thumbs up. I am very pleased with the recipes and the cookbook is making my life easier and providing a lot of variety.",1
"It took a while for me, until I finally added this book into my library. First I was afraid, that it might be a little bit outdated, but then I discovered the qualities of a timeless classic. Together with Raven Grimassis ""Wiccan Mysteries"" an intelligent and informative source of Wiccan history, written with a critical point of view. A must for Pagans and spirtual seekers.",1
Although the knife that I recieved is not the one pictured it is exactly what I was looking for. It is the black handle version with three rivets so I goes well with most other sets of good knifes. As for usablility it has a nice flex on the blade and is long enough that you can work with larger pieces of meat without it becoming a hinderance. This Knife has already earned a place in my kitchen after it handled a bone in leg of lamb that I was able to de-bone and remove veins in record time.,1

"Rather than being a book to recommend to beginners in philosophy, Sophie's World is a harmful book for the uninitiated since it does not deal with the most important philosophers of the (and for the) 19th and 20th Centuries, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.The author is not expected to deal with every philosopher. However, to omit Schopenhauer altogether and reduce the great Nietzsche to one sentence tears the heart out of the book.The book cannot claim to contain a legitimate overview of the world's important philosophers when it relates the ideas of Marx and Freud apparently at the expense of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.I would advise those who have read the book to study the impact that Schopenhauer and Nietzsche have had on the 20th Century, not to mention the influence they had over great artists such as Wagner and thinkers such as Freud.As far as recommending the book as a novel ... forget it.",0
"We reviewed this book for our library's book club but unanimously threw up our hands and declared ""no way!"" The author appears to hate smart women and the First Lady in particular. Made us wonder just how insecure he is and why. There is no documentation, a lot of ""hmmmmm""s to try to insinuate something, but the reader can't be sure. We told our library not to purchase any of this title. We asked them to spend the resources wisely, i.e., forget this one!!",0

"This is one of the best wall mounts available for the price (you would have to pay a lot more for better). The structure is very solid and sturdy. This is very heavy mount, say ~60 lbs, so the mount and TV will not be light weight. But, your TV will not wobble around as with cheap light weight mounts. The mount/TV adjustments are good.Other thoughts. The bags of hardware are all presorted, labeled, and easy to find individual parts. The instructions are ok, excessive multi-language manuals are not on my favorite's list. The wire clips (for cable harnessing) are bit too easy to break.What's all this lag bolt problem stuff? Drilling a 3/16 inch pilot hole into the studs if anything makes the lag bolts a tad too loose. Maybe 10 ft-lbs was needed to tighten the brackets to the wall. Perhaps a next size larger bolt would better to secure all the weight, better but not really necessary.Summary, don't fool around with anything less.",1

For Kidde, they've made high quality carbon monoxide alarms, but also a very convient prices. The Kidde KN-COBB Basic Carbin Monoxide Alarm is a very simple and easy to setup alarm. This alrm is very affordable, and you can easily hang it up, without any problems. It is also easy to install the batteries, unlike those that require a 9 Volt batteries.

"I generally do not spend my time writing movie reviews, but I feel a certain moral obligation to inform people not to waste 2 hours of their lives, and whatever it may cost financially, on this movie.I have never used the fast forward button so much in my life!The acting is AWFUL from Rourke's faking of playing the trumpet to Murray's portrayal of a bad guy who kills his wife because she is suddenly worthless to him due to infidelity!Rourke's character is too realistic for such an outrageous concept. He is a spineless, stupid, coward who is only good at getting his butt kicked! There is no real heroism!The scenes are not developed well; it seems as if, instead of building the story, most of the dialogue is meant to fill in time!The story is weak; the 'angel' was found in the garbage by a circus freak!AHHHHHH!

"I have gotten to page 74 and decided that I will not read any further. The author begins well enough to create a general feeling and mood about the neighborhood that she has moved into, but as she progresses into describing the neighbors in more detail, she seems to continually focus on what makes them different in a negative way. She constantly reminds the reader that she is not condenscending but she is! She is ""embarrassed"" to have dinner with her neighbors in the chapter ""The Mayor""- why - because they are poor! She describes another neighbor as a ""simpleton"" in ""Ahmed's Garden"" - why - because he does not have a good use of the Hebrew language! She never seems to be able to get into the neighbors' heads and view their lives through their eyes. The sentence structure throughout is tedious and by the time I get to the end of the sentence, I have lost the train of thought if there was one! Sorry, I pass on this one.",0
Miss Delafield's fictional diary is the funniest book I have read in a long time. Her sharp mind and wonderful sense of humour reflect the life of a middle class woman living in rural England with her silent husband and two delightful children. It was written in 1931 yet much has not changed. This obscure - to me - book was a great find and I look forward to reading further Diaries in the series.,1
"I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out but then they got a little on the pricey side and I eventually stopped using them.However, I forgot how well they do work. They are so easy to use too. Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you're like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled. I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you're done with it. And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose strips.Also, make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.",1

"Both of my children love this toy. My daughter received this for her first birthday, and could sing parts of the alphabet by two months later. The lights are very attractive to children and the music makes them dance. It is a very longlasting and durable toy.

"I've only worked through parts of chapter 5 (randomprocesses) so far, but I've found the treatment hereclearer than other books I've used.

Forexample, the notion of sigma algebra is introducedright at the beginning of the book, but with a lighttouch on notation and use of white space.",1

"The storyline behind Year Zero held so much promise, but fell apart like a cheap suit. The first half of the story held my attention and I enjoyed how the author attempted to tie together Science and Religion. However, I found myself more and more frustrated as I neared the end. The author did a poor job finishing character relationships. Maybe I had greater expectations when I read the book jacket that Religion would play a greater role. In my opinion, besides 'unleashing' the plague, which was also weakly done, Religion could have been left out of the story. I feel like getting half my money back because it really is only half a book.",0

Be careful with the heat settings, however. The highest worked great and the curl stayed for days but after just a few uses I noticed my hair was dried out and experiencing breakage (which is very rare for my normally healthy hair). Be sure to use a heat product on your hair and only use the highest setting if you have very resilient hair. Great iron. Great price!",1
"To me, this is such a precious book. The chocolate recipes are great, of course, but the thing that enchants me are the old pictures and drawings from the '30's.They are homey, and nostalgic, and reminds you of old days gone by, maybe at Gramma's house, when life was simpler.I would love to scan these pictures and hang them in my kitchen.

"First I should say that this story may be a little difficult to follow if you are not familiar with African storytelling. That said, it is bound to please anybody who is interested in West African culture.It's about a tyrant who rules with cruelty and magic. His greed and his son's lust for women with large buttocks eventually upset the people who rally against him with magic more powerful than his own.The scenery is spectacular. The mud architecture is impressive. And the costumes, especially the women's colorful dresses, are a delight. It is also fun to watch the women fight among themselves.",1

"... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream....",0

"Makes a great crust. Like almost all other bread machines, including the extinct Williams Sonama's, the whole grains do not knead well.

Seasons 1-5 (DVD) look exactly the same as season 6 (blu-ray).Also, there is no reason why this season could not be on 3 blu-ray discs. I own other shows on blu-ray, and the ENTIRE **SEASON** is on ONE disc. FYI, you can fit SIX HD one hour shows on blu-ray (see Weeds on blu-ray, 12+ episodes in 1080p (30mins) on ONE disc))I love the show, but no one should waste money on the blu-ray set with no improvement in quality.

"Romeo Must Die is a mildly entertaining film that just doesn't live up to its potential. Many of the reviews I have read compare it favorably to The Matrix, but this is ridiculous. Now, don't get me wrong...Jet Li is a phenomenal martial artist. Martial arts alone, however, do not make a great film. The acting was poor and the improbable fight sequences were downright silly, as they were physically impossible (at least in The Matrix, there is a logic that allows for gravity-defying flips, etc). Finally, the relationship between Han and Trish simply doesn't go far enough to warrant a ""Romeo & Juliet"" romantic link. They never even kiss for crying out loud! Overall, not a good film.",0

"Our youngest grandson will soon be 6 and has always been an avid book reader...Not that he has learned to read but that he loves to have someone read to him and then he will read by the pictures. We were lucky enough to take his two brothers and he on a weekend excursion. During that time, he was poky. Did not want to leave the pool, wanted to stay and watch TV, things that a five year old does. I discovered he had not heard this book yet, so I bought the kindle edition. We read it at least three times in 6 hours. Wonderful, wonderful book!",1
Well I bought this game with my own money.It worked.It was just how I expected it to be because i am a lego fan.BUT THIS GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE.REALLY SLOW.aND THE CHALLENGES ARE WAY TOO EASY.We need to add to the game.One of the challenges never works because it says it caused an error.,1

"This arm band is FANTASTIC! I highly recommend it. Keep it on all day and take it off at night. Tighten the strap if you are going to play tennis, loosen it for daily routine. I could feel my arm getting better each day. Within 3 weeks my arm with completely pain free. I LOVE IT!",1

"As an avid Stephanie Laurens reader - this book was just not up to par with her other books. I loved her Cynstar series books, but I really had to struggle to finish this one, and when I did I was disappointed. If you love her other books - I suggest that you pass this one - it is not up to the Lauren's style of sensual storylines with well-thought out characters.",0

Get with it, it's the suicide machines self titled record! It's a classic! THeir best probably (I do agree destruction by definition is in close competition), and if you enjoy good music with lots of great hooks , then throw away your bland old pennywise records or your bargain-bin-bound new found glory cds and pick this one up. Other recommendations if you like catchy punky music: Soft boys: underwater moonlight. Any greatest hits record by The Jam. The Shoes: Black Vinyl Shoes.",1
"Busted are the best band ever and I'm so surprised that they still haven't become popular here in north america with their second album coming up! they're great, especially if you like stuff like blink 182, blue, a mixture between british pop and american punk, its just brilliant!",1
"Being a gym rat, I've been dreaming of a reliable pair of wireless headphones for years and I finally found them! My brother in law has the Motorola behind the ear bluetooth set, but they were small for my head and plugged my ears too hard, which made them uncomfortable.These, on the other hand, are just the opposite. They fit a bit loose and could stand to be just a bit more snug. My only criticism of this set is that Sony decided to compromise the stability of the headset to make them foldable. Since they don't fold down to a dimension that is any more portable, my feedback is to do away with the folding in exchange for a sturdier design.The sound quality is quite good; I'd say about 90% of my iPhone earbuds. The mic works well enough for quick phone calls too. The battery life is great! Sometimes I don't need to charge for two days. All-in-all a great buy for around $50-really can't go wrong. I highly recommend!",1
"A nice piece of equipment with good sound. Unfortunately the documentation is substandard and the technical support is a practical joke - it's supposedly free for 60 days (not exactly generous is it?), but the catch is that it's a long-distance number and only open during office hours - you'd better be independently wealthy or have a very understanding boss.The website claims to be award-winning or some such thing but the Knowledge Base's designation flatters itself - very little knowledge.For the first two weeks I struggled to get it to record some of my favourite music. Constant problems with files not ripping or disappearing or being refused because they were apparently already on my pc. This wasn't the case and I got fed up of asking technical support for help. They'd give me answers but never to the question I'd actually asked.So, my wife has had an Ipod for months with no problems. Guess what I wish I'd bought?",0
"We had ordered this scale from another retailer last summer and it was stylish and to the best of our knowledge accurate. When my daughter went to college in September, I ordered what I believe is the same scale from Amazon and had it shipped directly to her. Last week I visited and learned that the weight the scale displays fluctuates wildly and my daughter had given up on it. Very disappointing!! This one may just have been a lemon - can't tell.",0
what i likethis radio picks distant mw statins . fm reception is great. sw reception is good.you can wake up by a predetermined statin with a predetermined volume.selctivity is very good sound is not bad.what i dont like .after 3 days of use the telescopic antenna detached from the radio . battery life is short. the adaptor makes noise with the weak am stations. the charger is better to be automatic like that of ka11. the volume control is annoying. time does not appear in the display while the radio is on . you must press a button first. it will be great if RDS exist,1
"Warning! You will be very disappointed if you expect a typical Alan Jackson CD. This is extremely bland and boring. Alan's voice is not suited for this type of music. I bought this today, and after listening once, I put it up for sale. I should have believed some of the other reviews. This is definitely Alan's worst CD ever. And one of the worst CD purchases I have ever made. Sorry Alan!!!!",0
"This wig did not look anything like the hairstyle that John Travolta wore in Grease. It also did not maintain it's shape after the first try-on and was to be used in a 3x event Lip-Sync production. I am sorry to say it was a waste of $$. So glad I grew my son's hair long, just in case.",0
"If you like 80s synthesizer music, you'll love the Terminator soundtrack. The pop stuff by Tryanglz and others is good, and the instrumental stuff is great...if that's your kind of music (it sure is mine). I guess now this stuff seems like kind of an amusing relic, but then it was seriously high-tech. I loved the music from this soundtrack then, and I still love it.The vocal stuff on this soundtrack is typical L.A. 1980s music, a la Missing Persons or Berlin (I can't really describe it better). The instrumental stuff is very ""Planet of the Apes '68"" with more synthesizer: kind of creepy and scary, and, for the time, pretty avant garde.If that sounds like your thing, you'll love this. If it's not, you should pass on it.",1
"I bought this easy walk harness for my Australian Shepherd. He's only 40lbs but has pulled me off my feet in the past. I've tried several other harnesses to get him to stop pulling. I've only had this a short while, but the walks have been the most enjoyable, as he does not pull my arms out of their sockets. I would recommend this product to anyone with a dog who pulls. It's fairly straight forward to fit and to use. Enjoy!",1
As soon as I opened this thing I realized the remote was broke. Then when I finally hooked it all up my picture was all blurry no matter what I did to it. Thank god I went HD and now I only have to worry about 2 wires. Get a HDTV !!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I'm watching the PBS series based on the book, which is why I bought it. So far, the television series is spot on. I'm still reading it; may update this review when I'm finished. Having lived and worked in the East End of London, some of the descriptions of the area are perfect. Even in the seventies, things weren't much improved from the period in the book. So far, very enjoyable.",1
"In a nutshell, all of the information in this book I had already learned from other sources while growing up (and, no, I'm not a salesmen and neither were any of my teachers). For the terminally uninformed, this would probably be a good book; for anyone else it would be a waste of money. This book is Not Recommended.",0
"Mandatory book for a class that failed to deliver academic quality work. While a nice enough read for airport commuters between flights, this book is rather simplistic and lacks that real impact. In short, this book talks about five dysfunctions, which are pretty well commonly understood by most managers/leaders.

"DRM is a massive headache. I tried this game on a friends PC and found it to be very lackluster. No matter what traits you give your character, the ""evolutions"" that take place are essentially the same. I guess that is ok if you are a ""divine plan"" believer, in which case the programmers could be considered a very uncreative diety.In any case you may enjoy this game until you need to reinstall windows after a computer failure or your next PC upgrade, in which case you need to fork over another $50 thanks to DRM technology.",0
"I enjoyed the levity over what is in reality a serious problem for many. Rebecca Bloomwood was adorable in this book. She couldn't help over-shopping and tried to talk herself out of it, but invariably talked herself into it. Shopping was ruining her life. Her life was filled with anxiety because there was no foreseeable way to get on top of her bills or stop shopping.I didn't feel Luke Brandon was a realistic character only because he was such a knight in shining armor to the extent that he was. Rebecca seemed realistic though, and that's what counts. Luke served a purpose in that he got her to use her talents, honed during years of hardcore shopping. The first half of the book was fun when the wonderful solution was not in reach and there was constant suspense.",1
"It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest, but works as a great scare tactic.Please, look at some of the sources used in the research. To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement (Air America, etc?). But, books that are preaching to the choir are a dime-a-dozen these days. The author has his select audience and he's trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions. There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water.",0
"I've burned up several lesser products and have purchased a larger unit each time a lesser one fails. I believe I'm going to have this one for awhile. The tip-out bag holder makes this one easier to use than most, and it seems strong enough for home use. While some may find the safety features annoying, I found that it's quite easy to learn to feed the paper without turning the unit off. When faced with a large job it occasionally stops to cool off before it approaches burn-out. If you can accept this by taking a short break yourself, then this unit should meet most of your home office needs.",1
This was a great addition to my husbands new Weber barbecue. I tried zucchini with mushrooms the first time and they were delicious. It is terrific for just about any combo of vegetables.,1
I ordered this product for my husband who plays golf and is out in the sun quite often. He puts it on his face and it protects him from burning. He really likes this product so I ordered more than one unit.,1
"I just received one last week and I love it - it must be improved because I can stick it in the frame, plug it in, and it begins the slide show. I unplug it, move it to another room and plug it in, and the slideshow begins again, automatically. As for picture distortion, I have none - I've displayed pictures in 1600x1200 (4 megapixle) resolution, and the same image resized to 1024x768 and 800x600 - all look the same (very nice) on the display. My assumption is that the manufacturer has improved on the model that people reviewed earlier - I'm very happy with it. Since getting it, I've kept it plugged in the whole time - it hasn't failed yet. There is one minor problem - the device gets warm, and the picture frame has a vent on the back - don't count on hanging this on a wall.",1
"I bought this book as a gift for our son. After it arrived, I looked through it and was very disappointed. I was sorry I bought it. I didn't find it funny or meaningful.

"I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save.",1

"This movie is a joke. The story line had promise, but it is so unrealistic. The campers didn't even have a good hunting knife or proper provisions. ""City kids!""

"Grace Moore led an exciting life and tells it well. A life in the '20's ""jet"" set among the luminaries of the time.

Exceptionally well witten and fast moving.I read this when I was in High School and have bought and given/loaned it many times since",1
"I've been a huge Goldfinger fan for a while and have loved everything they have put out. This is no exception. While this cd is alot less ska than ""Hang-ups"" it still has that same edgy guitar sound that makes them a hit all over the USA. I'd seriously have to say that this is there best work and I'm not saying that just because it's new. Every song on the cd is hard and fast except like on or two. My favorite songs are I'm down, Pick a Fight, Counting the Days, and Forgiveness. Please pick this up it is truley the best work of punk ever put together on a cd.",1
"Laughable dialogue, outlandish plot, zero-dimensional characters, pc run amuck and no editing. My favorite howler involved a blindfolded woman in a dark room who had her blindfold removed and then had to wait for her eyes to adjust to the dark. And one more reference to the hero's ""issues"" would have driven me over the edge. Take this book! Please!",0
"On the product site it says, ""...camcorder may not be recognized by the computer when connected. In this case, check to see if there is an updated driver available for your model."" There are no device driver updates available for this camcorder beyond XP. So, if you want to run it on any PC with Vista or Windows 7, that PC will not recognize the camera. When trying to install the camera software, Vista will block it and recommend getting an updated driver from the Sony site. Do that and you will see the quote above, and agree with this WARNING. This most likely applies to all Sony digital tape camcorders. So, be careful out there! Can't imagine spending $500 on this, either. I purchased mine in 2005 for $280.",0
"The story I read was Wrong Number 2. It was about three teenag kids, Deena, Jade and Chuck.They had an enemy, Stanley Farberson. Farberson was a murderer and he killed his wife. Now he was put in jail and Deena and Jade are in school. Chuck is in college. One night Deena and Jade came home from school the phone rang Jade asked if she could answer it. Deena picked up the phone 'Hello' she said no reply. 'Hello' she said again. Then a low voice answered 'Is jade there' a man with a scary said.Then he hung up the phone. As soon as Jade walked in the room Deena said ' A man was looking for you' .'Then he hung up' Deena said. 'Oh well'. So all night Deena and Jade were talking about the basketball game they were going to on Friday. At one thirty a.m. Deena went up to here room and went straight to bed. At three a.m the phone rang 'Hello' Deena said. The same man called and he said 'I already called your friend'. This Review Was Written By Ashley Estrada",1
"I've never done Pilates before, and when I started using this video, I didn't think it was going to do too much. But as I started paying attention to my allignment and muscles and everything, I realized it is actually working my muscles. My only complaint is I wish she would count out the reps (she only counts the first rep)- it's hard to keep an eye on the video and also stay in alignment. Also, I know that using the video can't be quite as good as having an instructor there to check that I'm doing it right, but as I've taken dance lessons for 20 years, I'm pretty in tune to how my body's lined up. The workout is only about 20 minutes, so it's good if I don't have a lot of time to work out. I would like to look at some longer and possibly more intense workout in the future. It's a good introduction, though, and has made me more interested in trying more.",1
I love this knife sharpener! It is one of the easiest and best ones I have owned and I have had quite a few. I highly recommend it.,1
"This book is so amateurish, so flimsey. In fact, its nothing more than a pamphlet filled with little usefull information. When I saw it in a bookstore -- I marvelled at how anyone could see clear to spend more than a couple bucks on it.

"I used this dough blender for not even 6 months, and the handle snapped! (mind you, I am not a pastry chef, so I was not using it everyday. I used it a handful of times.) I understand it has a 5 year warrenty, so i will try to get it replaced. I have to say that it worked great before it broke.",0
"By far one of the best compilations put together by razmormaid records on one disc and a personal favorite, wish there were more like this one!!

"I haven't a clue what the Amazon editorial reviewer means. What I do know is that of the many recordings I have heard of this piece, this one is unquestionably my favorite.

It worked great for about 3 weeks, until one day it shut down, and it never turned on again.I am not the only one who has had problems with the item, a friend bought at about the samne time I did, and one of the buttons doesnt work anymore.I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone, It looks nice, and it is cheap for what you get, but I would rather get something that works.",0
"This CD is fun. It is die hard PROG ROCK but fun. Lyrics border on the amusing, and Peter Sings them with vigor tongue and cheek... this is often not found in Prog music, since it tends to be very serious affairs to be in a Prog Band, but PETER GABRIEL just whips it good on this outing. I highly recommend this recording, but DO NOT FORGET Trespass or Foxtrot OR Selling England by the Pound OR OR OR Lamb Lies Down On Broadway... this is the greatest five prog recordings in a row by any group, even YES. Nobody did such wonderful prog music for five releases in a row. Just the greatest influence of underground Prog ever.",1
"I was really hoping Alicia would be the next great talent to save the name of good music. Wrong. I was starting to like ""Fallin'"" then I couldn't help but wonder.....is the piano part ""borrowed"" from James Brown's ""It's A Man's Man's Man's World"" ??? It was also pointed out that the chorus to ""Woman's Worth"" is a lifted vocal phrase of Ray Charles. So the music trend of stealing others music continues.The Prince cover is nothing to get giddy about and the rest of the album showcases the more superior talents of her background singers over her own singing talent. In short there was much hype over nothing. I figured with all the hype I was putting in the next Stevie Wonder.",0
This was super easy to attach the legs. Took me about 5 minutes from box to being able to sit on it at my piano. Very sturdy. I recommend this for anyone who has a Keyboard on legs and needs something at the correct height for playing it.,1
The victorian/classical style of the music is wonderful. Relaxing and charming. I found it to be very enjoyable.,1
Poor watch with extremely poor materials used. Battery drains wvery 4-6 months and poor timekeeper. Very Glossy and heavy case hides poor workmanship. Retails for approx $100 over web against ( laughed so much ) RRP $850 or thereabouts. Where do they get that figure from ???. I have bought a great quality fake Rolex for $90 and no one can tell the difference.,0

You don't get what you pay for and you can't get a hold of anyone. Where is the customer service?",0
"To sum it up, ""Aerobic Body Shaping"" is not as good as the older firm videos (Such as the Cross-trainer series and Total body shaping mix)The cardio segments are too slow, repetitive, boring, and stiff. I couldn't get my heart rate up. The lifting segments were OK, except for some of the lunges that were awkwardly executed on the incline step. The movements were so odd that I couldn't concentrate on any particular area of the lower body.At last, the abdominal segment was terrible.The instructor suggests that you straighten and extend your legs out to do the crunches. You end up just working your hip flexors and compressing your lower spine.I suggest you bend your knees to 90 degrees and push your belly button towards the floor, than proceed with the crunches.",0
"Olive Barstow and Martha Boyle were classmates, olive was quite, shy and didnt have friends. Martha was a creative writer, she had a older brother, and a younger sister. When olive gets hit by a car and dies, martha cant do anything without thinking of her because olives mother brought martha a journal entry about how olive wanted to be friends with , and wanted to see the ocean, and be a writer.

This is one awesome looking match for the Mac-mini. Actually looks like it was made by Apple....identical color and styling as Mac-mini. My 40GB Mac-mini was almost full with over 4000 songs and many digital pictures. I could no longer update my Ipod due to no more storage space on the hard-drive. My choices were increase the hard-drive capacity....$$$$$$$. The more economical option was to get an external hard-drive. I looked at over 20 different options and chose the Lacie 160GB model for the Mac-mini. Simple installation....didn't have to use the enclosed driver disk. Loaded in seconds and was ready for action. I highly recommend this for a great looking application that looks more like a piece of art than a bulky computer component.,1
"I recently bought this book after reading the excellent reviews about it, but unfortunately, I couldn't go beyond the first two chapters. It starts off nicely but loses the focus soon and becomes extremly boring.",0
"I have waited for this film for decades. I understood the quality may not be the best, but the film is excellent. The first copy had to be returned because it was defective. The second copy had to be returned because it was defective. I am now waiting for the third copy; sooner or later one will play without stopping and going back to the beginning. The letterbox is annoying. I have a 65-inch so I can tolerate it but if you have less that a 55-inch I suspect you will have difficulty seeing detail. My score considers all of the technical problems. If it were not letterboxed and worked properly the first time it would be much higher.",0
"After getting Yuval Ron's CD, ""Under The Olive Tree,"" I knew I needed to hear more. This CD definitely didn't disappoint. The collaboration of these great artists have created one of my favorite Sufi CD's to date. I highly recommend this to anyone.",1
I was highly dissapointed with this book Amy Goldman Koss wrote. It was a story of five girls who did nothing but stab each other in the back and keep scerets from each other. I will tell you now i will never buy another one of her books ever again.,0
"The super fast action sequences were ridiculous and laughable. There was no time to process and enjoy the action. Being hit with one super fast action after another was after a while boring. Here we go again, I thought as I watched the movie. It was like they created this Bond film with the intention to have the action sequences and special effects to be the stars of the movie rather than the gorgeous women and James Bond of earlier movies. This is the worst Bond film ever made.",0
"This book I was slightly disappointed in. I am no English Major or book maven, but the style of the writing is so bland and can be very hard to follow. Although there are some VERY interesting facts and stories, it was just a hard read.",0
"I think that if 800rsd can't pronounce a word as easy as hypernotomachia poliphili then he, or she, should stay with Dr. Seuss books. This book was amazingly written and is a gift from God the divine himself. I used to be a cocaine, pronounced ""coca eena"" for our vocabularily challenged 800rsd, addict. However, after reading Ian Caldwell's ""The Rule of Four"" my life has taken a complete 180. I'm now going back for my GED, I no longer have to play with men's phalluses for cocaine money, i've found God, yes that's right, I...found...God, lying underneath a rock on 3rd Avenue right outside my apartment!

"This tribute translates psychedelia to grunge. I LOVE this tribute. First of all it was one of the first of the glut of tributes. It seems that the bands all really were influenced by the band LOVE. Arthur Lee himself is really into this tribute and it's obvious that it wasn't done to take advantage of Lee's popularity. There's a refreshing niavity to it, I'm not sure they knew what they were doing or how impactful the medium of 'tribute album' could be.

"First, a nod to the two bad reviews: Males is, in fact, an incorrigible numbers wonk. Although I don't think his stats are dishonest, I do think he uses them, perhaps selectively, to support his important thesis, which I read as follows: Adults perceive teenagers negatively and this is due to the familiar sociological phenomenon of ""scapegoating."" WE screw up and look for someone to pin it on. I think Males is largely convincing in demonstrating that most of the familiar litany of ""what's wrong with these kids today"" is either (1) false (2) no worse or not as bad as the equivalent ""problem"" in adults or (3) caused by adult oppression of teenagers. It's a challenging and important book. Even if you buy only some of what Males argues, it may well change your view of teenagers forever.",1

"I don't think i have ever commented on anything before but I felt compelled this time around. I got my new SD1000 just a week ago and I must say while it is stylish and takes pictures very quickly... a very intuitive interface, very easy to use and the battery charges quite quickly..not everything is great....The biggest and most important issue i have is that it takes VERY poor pictures if the lighting isn't optimal. Most of my pictures come out with very grainy and this is with the auto ISO set or off. I have owned other Canon cameras and the quality of this one is by far the poorest to date. Very disappointed. I can't return the camera so I am either going to try and sell it or hand it over to younger sisters. I will have to get another cam now. *sigh*. Oh, it doesn't do video capture zoom either so take note.",0

"This book is toxic and advocates for child abuse. It is disgusting that Amazon continues to sell this book and others like it. This is not ""training"" a child, but breaking them.

Sure, they don't advocate ""spanking"" they advocate using objects other than a hand to beat your child into submission.If there is a hell, I hope that Michael and Debi Pearl wind up suffering for all eternity while being beaten with a 1/4 flexible plumbing line, just like they describe in this book.",0

"I got my travel lite brite free when I purchased the lite brite cube. I'm glad I didn't pay for it.I suspect that no one at Hasbro actually used this. It's not very travel friendly at all.First, they put the compartment to hold the pegs on the bottom with a lid that flips down. Open it up and everything pours out.I ""fixed"" this by removing the Lite Brite sticker, putting a generic pony sticker over the spot and telling my daughter that the compartment goes on top. (I changed the sticker so my daughter wouldn't hold it the wrong way.) The compartment works pretty good when it's on top.Then, the light turns off automatically which is nice for saving batteries, but the timing is way too short! You have to constantly keep pushing the button which gets frustrating when you're trying to use it in a dark car.These are two simple things that could have been remedied with a little fore-thought and play-testing.",0
"Too general to instruct, too bland to entertain, this soporific release from a husband and wife--or corpse and corpse--induces ennui, not edificxation. All books on the subject are more helpful: those books will have more sample test-taking strategies, will illustate more re colleges' relationship to score, and will break down exactly what a 1200 on a SAT means: the number wrong, the weaknesses inherent in such a score, the levels of Un iversities that will either laugh or accept. There should be something on the new SAT's (in 18 months) and the supposed racism that is built inside these questions. A history of ETSA, an overview of ACT's, and any reference to the MANY contreoversies that thse tests evoke would also flesh this slim and stupid volume out. This book would fit comfortably at the bottom of a parrot's cage, but be warned: animal may lkaern to speak like a smug lawyer who never had one original thought.",0

"Wow, I've never seen such awful trash in my entire life. Every other word is a senseless vulgarity. No plot, just pointless sexual scenarios. I have a friend who works in a bookstore near where Mr. Livingstone lives, and they've sold 2 copies of the book--and both were returned. Don't waste your time with this overly erotic wasteland. If you want to read something that's actually respectable and Baltimore-related, read Baltimore Blues by Laura Lippman. She makes Baltimoreans proud to be associated with the city, whereas Livingstone's book just makes us want to move to Detroit. Save yourself the embarrassment and the money",0

"As the owner of a new baby Congo African Grey parrot, I wanted to learn about how best to care for one. This book came highly rated, so I purchased it and read it. In general I found the layout of the book and its pictures to be very good. In terms of actual hands on help, I unfortunately found it to be lacking for my purposes.The book spent a great deal of time on the construction and placement of outdoor aviaries, as well as breeding activities, so if one is looking for such information, then this book might be a good source of such. My intention was to have a companion indoor bird, which, I believe, is the intention of most potential owners of these birds.As a retired clinical geneticist, I found some of the genetics discussions to be lacking. In addition, the book was published in 1995, and, as such, some of material is somewhat dated.",0

"Such a disappointment. The digital readout is not lit, so the only way to see the clock at night is to look at the ceiling. Fine if you're in bed, otherwise, useless. It does have a button you can push to turn on a light... but by that time I'm way too annoyed anyway. It also has the most obnoxious high-pitched beeping for the alarm - which was complicated to use anyway. I have already tossed this piece of junk and got my son a decent radio alarm clock with a light. Far more practical than the projection feature. The only positives are that it is compact and self-setting. Don't buy this thing.",0
"First of all, most of the people trashing Anne's writing ability wouldn't be able to write a full length novel with her depth and wonderful prose, let alone dozens of novels!

"We bought this as a packaged deal with the Rainbow in My Room. We gave the moon to my 2 1/2 year old son and the rainbow to my 6 1/2 year old daughter. The moon is awesome! He has always been consumed with the moon- spotting it before anyone else- so we knew he would love this. It is simple to use, easy enough for him to operate himself. He sets it as high or low as he wants it for the night (after playing with it for a couple of minutes). We put batteries in it at Christmas and the batteries have not had to be replaced after using it EVERY single night since.We love the Rainbow just as much and I would highly recommend both of these toys if your child shows any interest in the outdoors.",1
"I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing from Lucy, since following up their amazing debut would have been near impossible. After listening for awhile I've come to a verdict. This album surpassed my expectations - for the worse. This is what they call bad music folks. For the fan who called ""Butterfly"" a masterpiece... you must have the worst musical taste imaginable. I respect everyone's opinion, but come on. How can anything on this album even be considered above average. Simple Lessons is the only decent song, but it still doesn't have half the impact that any of the songs off of their debut had.And for the person arguing that Lucy wasn't a disappointment because it had three music videos, I have news for you. The record company kept ordering videos probably in a desperate attempt to create a buzz about the album... too bad they failed miserably.",0
When this book first was about to come out I was waiting with so much excitement only to be diappointed... too orientalist for my tastes...,0
I was delighted to be able to read about this amazing woman from the viewpoint of herself and those who testified of her. The story is very well written; the historical evidence woven together with just enough commentary to understand the political/historical climate and stuation in which these events took place.,1
I have always wanted to learn Spanish and so I have bought several things to help. This is by far the best of them because i actually took this on an eight hour trip with a family member and we loved learnign from it. It is correct when it says you learn spanish quickly. So if you buy it and are taking a trip stop at an authentic Mexican place and try out your new found knowledge after disc #2. You will surprised what you know about the language.,1
"This book is about a vampire but it never once uses the word ""vampire"". It also never uses the word ""blood"" except in a couple of places related to normal human violence. This is a clever detour from the typical vampire genre.You meet a character you're pretty sure is a werewolf, but it never uses that word. I really enjoyed reading this book, which came out long before the new vampire craze.",1
"I love this book, because it help me in my studies about Mansfield and Woolf. The book was sent fastly.",0
"First of all, I'm 15 and this is my mom's CD and I well, kinda stole it for a while, hahaha. This is a really good CD. I had heard of Joni Mitchell before, but I had never heard her music before. It's really really good. My favorite song is ""Big Yellow Taxi"" which is a really good song. ""They paved paradise and put up a parking lot""... Doesn't is seem like they're doing that a lot today? Some other notable songs include ""Chelsea Morning"" and ""Woodstock"" and ""Both Sides Now"". I really reccomend this CD to anyone, especially those who are new to Joni Mitchell, like me. It's great, you won't regret it! Enjoy!",1
The book cover was cut as well as many pages up into the first chapter. The book was listed as very good like new. The book reeked with smoke. I am allergic to smoke. I was very disappointed.,0
"I had high hopes, but they were dashed on the jagged rocks below. I thought this cd would sound more like their previous effort, Come Clean, but lo and behold it doesn't The songs all sound exactly alike, the cd is much softer, and nothing sticks with you at all. The tracks are impossible to differentiate between. However, there are three good songs: Cloud 9, Away from Me, and Spin you Around. Listening to those will give you a good feel for what the rest of the album is like. But this really isn't worth getting. Do yourself a favor and pick up these 4 cds to satisfy all of your mainstream hardrock needs:1.) Sevendust- Seasons2.) Mushroomhead- Xiii3.) Hoobastank- The Reason4.) Alien Antfarm- truANTThese are the only hard rock cds released in 2003 worth getting.",0
"I hadn't even hit the stories yet, but reading the beginning of the book already had me motivated! It really has great ideas on putting your plans to action, and even making those little ideas in your head seem like they can be reality. Definitely makes you think ""why can't I?"" Suggest this book for anyone, it really helped me get my mind going again when I was lost and down in the dumps about where my life was going.",1
"Um, can you say one of the worst movies ever? The only man that fell here was me..falling for the price of renting this horrible movie! Lifeless, dreary, and humorless. Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot: A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues. Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone). Stone looks stoned. Stone looks yucky. Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits. No. Maybe it was the awful acting. Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care. But if you want a ""gripping psychological thriller"" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking. What a waste of talent.",0
"We bought this instead of the Kitchen Aid; it looked like it was very well built and the price was right. Wish we had bought the Kitchen Aid [this replaced an old Kitchen Aid]. The beaters do not come close to the bottom of the bowl, always leaving an unmixed area. There is no adjustment for it. When I contacted their customer service about it, they were not concerned about it and of no help, so I would rate their customer service even lower than the usefulness of this appliance. It's about ready to go to the Goodwill and get a mixer that works. Stick with Kitchen Aid... they work the way that they are supposed to.",0

"I recently wired my basement for a projection TV, full sound system, etc but screwed up and did not run a wire for my TiVo output upstairs to the basement. Getting another TiVo wasn't as much money issue as having all the shows, etc at one source. I bought the Leapfrog in the hope that I would not have to cut through drywall.Bottom line: it works great! Set up was something like ten minutes. I initially had interference from my 2.4 GHz phone, which I was replacing anyway with a new 5.8 GHz system (Uniden- works great too). When I did that, I get the same image quality downstairs as upstairs (component video isn't great, but workable for TV). The IR relay works well, though I hear a quick buzz through the audio (low, but noticable) when any TiVo remote button is pressed. I get no interference with my 2.4 Ghz D-Link wireless network.This product saved me a tons of time, and will pay for itself in a few months.",1

"This is the story of Libby, a Texan who goes to Rome to marry her true love. Once she arrives things seem to take on a bizarre life. On her way home she meets Ethan Redwine and his family and from that moment on her world is turned upside down.This book has taught me to never judge a book by it's cover. I had this book for awhile before reading it. Now I'm sorry I waited so long. This book is fully of funny characters and incidents. I was cheering Ethan and Libby on from the moment they met. I literally laughed out loud while reading this book. The author did an excellent job of making this story a light fun-to-read experience. It is entertaining from the first page to the last. You won't be disappointed.",1
"Yes, this product deserves zero stars. It's too bad that's not offered as an option.Toshiba has perfected the art of engineering a product that will only last a few weeks beyond the expiration of its warranty. How that saves them money I don't know, but I assume they've found the cheapest parts available.This thing will read absolutely nothing that's put into it, and I bought it brand new about a hundred days ago. Its warranty is good for 90 days.Needless to say, I will NEVER buy a Toshiba product again. All I got out of this experience is that knowledge and the chance to pass it on to others. Learn from my lesson!",0
I have bought several sizes of the Bodum Glasses. They are well designed of especially strong glass that can hold hot or cold drinks. With the double wall there is no need for a coaster because the glasses do not sweat and hot drinks do not burn the hands. My favorite size is the 12oz.,1

"I was very excited to use this cookbook, as I've made all of my 10-month-old's food since he started eating solids at 6 months. I was interested in finding some new and different recipes, so I thought I'd give this book a try after reading other reviews. I enjoyed some of the first few chapters, which talked about everything from food safety and the nutrients in food to organic vs. non-organic. Unfortunately, I've found the recipes to be terrible. Not one I've tried has turned out; they've been awful. I consider myself to be a fairly good home cook. I cook every day and make many recipes for our family from foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com that come out perfectly. I follow the recipes in this book exactly, but nothing I've tried has been worth eating, and it's so frustrating to waste such good, organic ingredients! I wouldn't recommend this book. If you want a wonderful baby food cookbook, try Tyler Florence's book: Start Fresh.",0
"This book actually makes excellent reading for any woman (or even the rare man) who is interested in the ways ""spiritualism"" abuses women.

"I bought this particular brand because of the name and the appearance of the sample picture. It looked like a good heavy duty cable that justified 2x the price of a cheap cable. What I got is just a cheap cable. It works, but it's no better than the no-name brand cables at half this price.",1
"All my kids (ages 3-10) LOVED Kid Pix 3 so when I lost it in a computer mishap I was excited that there was a newer version. The newer versions are SUPPOSED to be better, AREN'T THEY??? Well, imagine my disgust when I installed and ran it for the first time and this little 6 inch square pops up surrounded by inches and inches of blacked out wasted screen. Version 3 filled the entire screen and everything was sized much larger and therefore easier on the eye and more exciting to work with. I did all the techie stuff. This is just version 4...a tiny little area with tiny little icons that nobody wants to play with now. I'm giving this away.",0
"My Mother comes from the Black Forest in Germany where the Legend Of The Werewolf originated so I was hoping for a good read in this book but I was very disappointed. If you take away the elements of the Supernatural, the Graphic and Gratuitous Sex and the Extreme Violence all you are left with is this loser who falls in love with a crazy woman.That's all there is to this story and as an aside it also promotes unsafe sex if the woman is attractive enough which I think is highly irresponsible.",0

"I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see. However, my major disappointment comes from the graphics. I understand the ps2 doesn't not have the standards of the XBox360, but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for. I just hope when the ps3 comes out, Madden will rerelease the game for it to give the XBox360 owners something to whine about. EA should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have.",0
"Susan was hired for these two albums to sing in the manner which Stephin wanted her to sing. It's no accident that she sang on some of the tracks, in what has been termed ""bland"" ""monotone"" etc.This is the effect Stephin wanted so this is exactly how Susan sang the songs, under Stephin's explicit direction. Susan has an amazing vocal range. If you doubt this just listen to some of her early art/punk ""V;"" work. As I said, her vocal range is amazing.",1

I ordered my normal size (9) and even have a different pair of similar boots in chestnut (they are 8"" ones) that fit great...unfortunately, these did NOT fit the bill at ALL and I'll be returning them for sure.",0
"Like many other reviewers, I experienced the annoying nuisance of the trimmer length setting decreasing with normal pressure applied while trimming. This is really a huge problem. I have cut my beard too short twice as a result of this design flaw. Norelco should send us out new trimmers, guys! I also agree that the vacuum is a waste, as unless it retains most of the hairs (which it doesn't), you still have to clean up the sink. Finally, having to manually change out the trimmer head to trim your mustache, ears, etc is a pain, and really not all that easy. I like the older design with a flip-out small trimmer head for the latter functions. The T980 is an example of ""newer is definitely not better"". Back to the drawing board, PLEASE, Norelco.",0
"I bought this hairdryer December 21 from amazon. I filled out the registration paperwork and submitted it. I got an e-mail from T3 telling me that Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer and that I should return the item immediately and refute the charge with my credit card company. ""If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, they cannot guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance."" So for $160, I don't know if I'm getting a knock-off or what I'm getting--but whatever it is, it doesn't carry the 4-year warranty you would normally get.Amazon never allowed me to give seller feedback on this product.I liked that the hairdryer was quiet. Maybe it dried my hair a little faster? Maybe my hair was a little smoother?? I definitely didn't like the location of the switches on the handle.Bottom line--buyer beware!",0

"Remakes are almost always a bad idea, whether it's in songs or films. There are exceptions (including coincidentally ""I Fought The Law"" remade by the Clash) but you won't find any on this tribute album.The performers that try to stay close to the original end up watering it down in quality, and the ones who try to make the songs their own aren't as talented as the Clash and also end up with an inferior version. This whole CD puts me to sleep, except for the Ice Cube and Mack 10 version of ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go"" which I confess I can't listen all the way through due to my intense dislike for rap.Like all bad remakes, the only reason this one was put out was for money -- not to honor a great band! If you want to honor the Clash, buy one of their original albums and avoid from this tribute.",0

"I bought this camera along with a Canon printer because of the rebate and I needed both of them. When I got this camera, it was just simply amazing. Fine quality images, easy functions, and small size makes it an ideal camera to take around with you when you're on a road trip. However, one thing I don't like about it is the material. If you're finger is dirty you may smudged the aluminum on it and it's hard to clean it off. I tried water and it doesn't seems to make that much of a difference. It's not really visible to the naked eye but nevertheless, it annoys me. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good camera. I don't regret buying it.",1
"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life!! It was so anticlimatic, which was even more disappointing since I had to force myself to the end hoping something would finally happen!!

"You don't need any reviews - yes, even including mine. The author is gifted, his style is magical realism, his substance true. It's difficult to explain Garcia Marquez to someone who has never read him, I did not care for him after reading my first story (in a scholastic course) ""The Very Old Man With Enormous Wings"" - my first trip with the man. Since I came to an understanding the simplicity and beauty has blown me away. I highly recommend ""One Hundred Years Of Solitude,"" ""Love and Other Demons"" ... anything you can get your hands on by Garcia Marquez - he speaks of the human condition, including not in the least, their dreams.",0
"For the price these are great lifting straps. The non-slip grip works great as long as you roll single layer.

"We just purchased this trike for our son's 4th birthday after we saw the twin boys down the street riding them. What's nice is that it's easy to peddle, it's smooth-riding, and it's not loud. My son really flies on it, which he loves. It took my husband about an hour to assemble, but for someone really handy, half that time. It also turns into a tricycle when you turn it over. Great-looking trike and nicely constructed. Very happy with our purchase.",1

"This book has been a bed time favorite of both of our children. It combines counting, rhyming and repitition to create the adventure of James and his yellow rain coat as they find out the games that his animal friends play when it rains. This is an excellent book to use with four and five year olds to help introduce them to reading. The counting helps with math skills and there is a predictablility that allows children to feel they are really learning to read. I highly recommend this classic before it goes out of print!!",1
Special effects are just OK and that is not enough to make up for an insipid story. Do not buy.,0
"Great CD - great songs, great performances, and interesting dialogue clips between some tracks. Highlights are Stormy Monday, Pride and Joy (SRV's only vocal), and the long, simmering Blues at Sunrise.I bought this CD primarily because of SRV, however, after I couldn't stop listening to it over and over again, I started collecting several Albert King titles - the classic Born Under a Bad Sign, Hard Bargain, Live Wire, the Stax Profile. All are consistently excellent and recommended if you enjoy this session.",1
It is very durable and compact. Could have been just a little bit bigger to store extra battery and memory card.,1

"Sorry, but I don't like this album too much. 4 Out of 11 tracks (2,6,7,10)are quite good, but the rest are duds. However, I don't think that Mr. Peaston's singing is to blame, but the lousy material he has to work with. His previous album, Introducing David Peaston is an excellent recording. It demonstrates that if Mr. Peaston only had half the talent he does, he could more than hold his own against artists like Brian McKnight, Luther Vandross, or Babyface. Maybe if he started writing more like the aforementioned artists, he could have done more in his singing career. Mr. Peaston has only co-written a total of two songs between these two albums, and I think these are some of the better songs on which they appear. Who knows? Maybe he'll surprise us with something new. We can only hope.",0
I received the changing pad in mail yesterday. I bought it based on the positive reviews. I only give it a 4 out of 5 b/c I have not used the pad yet. It looks like it will be a good changing pad but I will just have to wait and see.,1
"Godzilla comes out from the ocean to save the world from an evil alien trying to take over the world. This movie is so poorly written and acted, with more holes than a cheese grater. The special effects looks like a 1970s movie rather than a 2000 movie. If you want a good laugh at how bad movies can get, put this on the top of your list.",0
This particular charger is useless. Used it one time and it will no longer charge. Will no longer make the connection between the replaceable plug-ins.,0

"We held a potluck dinner party on the weekend and asked everyone to prepare a dish from Sarah's cookbook. It was an absolute blast. The chili is absolutley delicious.The Thai curry was fabulous, although we spiced it up to make it really hot.The risotto was wonderful, although we used chicken stock.The Curried Lentil Salad was absolutely delicious. We had several appetizers and desserts as well (the Creme Brulee was so good--I had no idea it was so easy to make). Everything was fabulous.The dishes we all chose to make were relatively easy to prepare. I should mention that it was a costume party, and one of my friends dressed up a Rex--Sarah's dog. It was good fun and this is a really good cookbook. Congratulations Sarah!",1

"I had problems with one of these units (left ear piece stopped working after a mere 15 minutes of use), but ultimately got a replacement and bought and additional one and both are fine. The ear pads are exceptionally comfortable, but the head piece is poorly designed and digs into your head above your ears. As for audio quality, well, you get what you pay for, but it's not too bad. Not audiophile, but great for use on a computer.",0

Some of the things you expected to happend did, and i liked the part about Elayne and Aviendha and some parts about Rand and to my suprise the things about Perrin. But my biggest letdown what that there wasn't anything about Mat. I guess the next book will be almost only Mat. but thats a weak comfort when that date is 2 years away.",1

"I ordered this for the stairs that lead to my 2nd floor; to keep my dogs from going up stairs and for my cats to be able to come up and down as they like, it is the best money I've spent! This was super easy to install - you can install it as more of a permanent fixture (use the screws to hold more solid) or not- I chose not to use the screws and have more as a temporary gate - but it's still just a solid. I would highly recommend this!",1
"Great episode, My Grandson loves this, he likes to play like he is the shape bandit.I would recommend this video.",1
The batteries that came with the mouse lasted a month to me. About 4-5 hr of use every weekday. I always remember to turn off the mouse when i not use it. So i guess i have used optimized the use of the battery.I suggest you buy two higher capacity batteries for it.The mouse overall is GREAT! Really convenient for light weight laptops.,1
"This is an updated, modern, slick and stylish new ""V"". I loved the campiness of the original mini-series and was dubious that the new version could capture me, but I was WRONG! It is terrific, and the beautiful, but deadly Anna is mesmerizing! Good acting, great special effects and a story just interesting enough to carry the thing along, makes me impatient for each new episode. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate this series! (Yes, it is funny, as well as exciting.)",1

"We purchased this blimp expecting it to be a no nonsense remote control toy. It requires you purchase HELIUM seperately, ( at least $20.00), and special batteries found only at radio shack or on the internet. It was a last minute scramble to have all the operating tools to have it ready for Christmas morning!! Thank God I took it out of the box and read the directions BEFORE wrapping!! It is huge and only an indoor toy, so if you live in cramped quarters forget it!",0
"Dont buy this book! The only recipe who i found deligtful was the ""Indian Meditation"" blend. For an example, does anyone know where to buy an oz or two of Musk Root?! By the way, the best part to use from the cedar is the bark or the gum NOT the foilage!Danny",0
"I read this book in one day! I could not put it down and stayed up until 3:00am reading it. If you like romance and a good story along with it this is the book for you. I have not read the other books in this series but after this book I am hooked. I was worried since I had not read the others this would be hard to follow but it was not. It is a story all its own, One I know I will want to read again.",1

"This should definitely be a made for TV movie as it was totally predictable! This couple submits an ad to become swingers to spice up their love life. Later they decide they don't need these people anymore but they won't let down...I am sure you can figure out the rest from there, this movie was a total cliche.",0
This is an insightful book with regards to teaching reading comprehension. I believe it truly focuses on the differences between comprehension skills needed during reading and comprehension skills students use for application. I would recommend this book to anyone.,1
"This Pack 'n' Play is nice for its simple unisex colors, its clean design, and its generous size. We have used this on many road trips. It's usually in our living room, and we use it as a toy chest when our son's not playing or sleeping in it.",1
"After much public feuding with Warner Bros, he agreed to deliver them one more new studio album, and promptly knocked this out over a long weekend. While the production doesn't sound rushed, the tunes seem like he made them up on the spot: routine funk like ""Dig U Better Dead"" and ""I Rock, Therefore I Am"" is prolonged by boring guest rappers; ""Dinner With Delores"" recycles ""Money Don't Matter 2Night""'s pop sound; ""Zannalee,"" the most enjoyable track on the CD, is just an uptempo blues. Lyrically too, it's all reruns. The silver lining is that, under pressure to create excitement quickly, he falls back on the exquisite lead guitar playing that he often displays in concert but has rarely recorded; the otherwise generic rocker ""I Like It There"" and ballad ""I Will"" benefit from this treatment. Michael Bland's drumming is also spotlighted more than on earlier releases. He's capable of so much better that you'd have to be a completist to want this.",0
"I really like this compact little drying rack. It is great in a small laundry room. I did want to mention that the template on the box was completely wrong. That was very annoying, especially when you have to install anchor bolts for one of the sides because it is not a full 32"" wide. Even with a 1/2"" wider I think I could have gotten both ends into a stud. O-well, other than that, it works great. I've hung up 4 sweaters on it at a time. I got it primarily to hang cloth diapers which it is perfect. It retracts very easily. I saw another reviewer mention that their's gets stuck. I haven't had any problem with that (yet). Overall, it works great for what I need it for!",1
Big Ripoff. It began losing air as soon as I inflated for the first time. We will not buy another one.,0

I watched it with my friends, when we were children and we played beeing John and Ponch with our bicycles on the street. Please release this show immediately.

Thats about it.Also must use 1/4 in. stereo phono plug in HD mode to hear sound.",0
"This is one of two books I found on the Parker-Hulme case. It approaches the story from a strictly lesbian point of view, which is interesting and somewhat valid; however, I think the writer misinterprets homoeroticism as strongly based love. I never did make it to the end of this book, mainly because I had to mentally edit the text for hyperbole. Once you've found the Parker-Hulme case you'll want to look for anything remotely associated with it, and there isn't much to find. Read this with a grain of salt.",0
"This book is dazzling, regardless of whether you like Jewish stories or not. The stories appear to be entirely artless yet they are carefully and brilliantly crafted. My son, who is eight, was as enchanted by them as I was. Highly recommended.",1
"Goodman & Gilman remains THE pharmacology textbook The introduction to each section gives a welcome overview of, and feel for what is important. Detailed reading is necessary for the serious student - missing a single line can give a false impression of the intended meaning. Thorough explanations with detailed graphics provide deep understanding where the reader desires. Difficult at times but worth the effort.",1
"This is a wonderful book, involving, absorbing, original, and totally can't-stop-reading-it! The characters are funny and wise, and the reader is drawn into the story with no chance of leaving until the end, which comes too soon. I also loved Davis' book of short stories (Circling the Drain) and look forward to the next offering from this exciting and talented new author.",1
"I must admit I was very much disappointed in not only this book but the last two! The series began with such a bang - holding your interest page after page. Now... sadly, the writers have choosen to drag the story out in an effort to simply make more money. I am so disappointed with them that I doubt I will read the next book... Honestly - they could have summed this up 2 books ago!",0
"The product works well, but only runs for six minutes before the battery dies and needs to be recharged. The battery itself loses its ability to recharge after about a year and the replacement costs...wait for it...$75.00! The performance is good, but not so spectacular it justifies the price and expensive battery replacement cost.",0
"These were my first pointe shoes and I absolutely hated them. They had an extremely hard shank, the box was rounded and restrictive and bulky. They had a great demi, but terrible look and feel on pointe. I would not recomend these as a first shoe because it's likely that the dancer's feet are not strong yet, and even though it's neccesary to have a supportive box and shank, you need to be able to go over the box and have a more pliable shank.",0

"I looked at a lot of slippers before picking this one. None fulfilled all of what I was looking for. In the end I'm happy but I wish the sole extended fully to the outer edge of the foot to be more stable. Also if the back of the slipper extended higher up toward the ankle, it would prevent my heal from lifting out when walking quickly.",1
"While this book certainly covers a lot of ground, it is painfully lacking in derivations or examples. I beleive it would be a reasonable book to use (as a reference) for someone who has already mastered quantum mechanics, but it is almost impossible to learn out of. Also, if you want a very terse, yet comprehensive reference, why bother with something other than Landau?",0
"This movie was terrible and I didn't think that it lived up to the hype advertised. It was so bad I returned it and requested my money back. Picture was awful, sound was terrible and definitely not worth the money I spent.",0

"Daneen Boone (Justine) is portrayed as a nieve, overly-protected student at an all girls school, where she is kidnapped in the shower by professional thieves looking for lost treasures. Under a hypnotic influence, Justine reveals her wild exotic voyeuristic adventures which have occured around the world. Her provacative fantasies are descriptive and visually leave nothing to the imagination. Justine's sensual adventures display how she is overcomed by seduction and gradually loses her innocence, finding sexual freedom and love through her voyeuristic journeys. The plot has been sacrificed for an abundant amount of nudity. The film is a soft-porn flick, however Daneen Boone is a fresh young face and beautiful to admire.",0
"Unit apparently has a faulty battery. I've been dealing with the iRobot service department for almost two months.One service rep was convinced that the battery was in a state of ""deep discharge"".

Those problems are rare. He directs me to return the unit.So, I have a new unit and the same old battery which STILL DOES NOT WORK.",0

"I really like the way this book is setup. You can read from beginning to end, chapter by chapter, or use the index. This book held my interest not only because it is so informative, but the great cartoon strips and graphics explaining how our body works makes it a fun way to have a better understanding of our health needs.This book isn't preachy yet drives home the point of how our lifestyle affects our bodies and what habits are bad for us. The menus were very helpful, however the recipes weren't that appealing to me, but since I haven't tried one yet, I'll reserve judgment. They may well be very delicious. I am definitely adding more of Dr. Roizen and Dr. Oz's books to my collection.",1
"I received this cookbook as an engagement present, and I've made almost all the recipes. They are easy to follow, and I love the fact that they are based on two people - I dislike having to divide portions in most recipes because they are usually written for 4 to 6 people.The dishes have all come out delicious. It's a cookbook I turn to quite often.",1

"I loved this album when it first came out. However I cannotrecommend the DTS version simply beacause the orignal tracks were recorded very poorly. Although ""Nights in white satin"" sounded awesome over the radio in the 60's, the sonic quality of the basic tracks is poor. The orchestra sounds thin. And all the 5-channel tricks in the world can't rectify that fact.I'm disappointed and I don't think its worth the [money]But you decide which is right - and which is an illussion!",0
I can't say what the headset sounds like because I am unable to use it with my phone. I have a 3.5 jack (pretty much the standard) and this headset has a 2.5 plug.It does not communicate the plug size in the web page.

This toaster look great but it doesn't make toast worth a darn. I have to flip each piece of bread around for complete toasting because it toasts only one side at a time. Very disappointed.,0
"This is the book that changed my life. Nothing else has even come close. In very simple, shallow, easy language, Dr. Berne explores the deepest topics of human behavior and interaction, revealing to you where your beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes come from. This process is extremely painful, and extremely helpful. I recommend this book to everyone looking to improve his or her life in any way. This is the book that opened my eyes to the possibility of improving my life. After I finished this book and the process of assimilating what I had learned, I quickly devoured the remaining texts on Transactional Analysis (I'm Okay, You're Okay; Staying Okay; Games People Play; Born to Win; and a few more). All of them were helpful to some extent, but I think I was fortunate to read this one first. And in response to the 1 star comment, I'd like to say Games People Play talked about other people. This book talks about YOU.",1
"This a great sampler of an even greater series of reissue compilations from legendary jazz label blue note records. Being that it is a sampler, there are quite a few varied styles here, not that that is always a bad thing. The only time it does create a slightly unbalanced listen is on the funky ""expressway to your heart"", which opens the album. Though i really like the song, it doesn't really fit in with all the other jazz oriented tracks. a great economical sampler.",1

I find it useful to walk into B&N with empty boxes inside of bags - fill'em up!!",1

"If you have to develop for the Weblogic Server 6, this book gives you quite a good overview/basis. Although BEA has a very good online presence for developers; a book like this one comes in handy, especially before you start your real life ""WLS 6 Internet Java J2EE Project"". You should already be familiar with the J2EE technologies, though, as this book is not a J2EE primer.Before I define the overall architecture of a real life customer project, I do a prototype to see, if all my ideas on how I would like the final, overall development & deployment, work together well. This book and the CD examples are quite helpful for this task when working on WLS 6.I would thus recommend this book if your project will be deployed on Weblogic, but use other books and online material additionally for the J2EE techniques, on which you decide to develop your project productively.",1
"Chapter ""Locking of Horns"", is quite unnecessary. I was put-off by the questioner's shallowness in posing a pedestrian question like ""..name the most remarkable man you have met"". This question gives UG (who is ever so ready!) a chance to cast his prejudiced views on JK.",0
"Don't buy this tug boat!! I recieved this to give to my son for his birthday and it left him in tears. He put it in the water the first 30 mins after having it and the motor would NOT turn off by the switch or the boat when he pulled it out of the water. There for we had to open it up to un-hook the battery so the motor would not blow up. My son was so anticipation to get this, but was let down and left him upset. I read the reviews and it all says it, that the motor will not turn off. Reluctantly I took a chance, but regretful now. I strongly advice it NOT TO BUY this product!!

"I ordered these for a walker my father-in-law had. It looked like these were interchangeable and I don't know what brand the walker was (whatever labels there were are gone). The little push buttons don't fit these holes - the holes are a little too small, and the tubes are too long to use the bottom holes (hit the cross member first). Wasn't enough money to return but close only counts in ...P.S. After modifying these wheels by cutting off the 'too long' tubes and drilling out the holes to fit the buttons, I mounted them and they are crooked. Obviously I cannot return now, or I would. And I don't think it is my doing. Nothing I did would change the alignment. Poorly made for sure.",0
"I only watched a bit of this as it turned out NOT to have subtitles which my husband needs.

I ordered two of the Long Arm Grabbers.When they arrived.One was nicely packed and sealed in the bag .The other bag was open. Upon examining these items I found the one in the open bag did not work.The clip holding the wire in the arm had come loose so nothing happened when the handle was grasped to pick up objects.It was obvious that this item was broken when I took it from the unsealed bag.I believe it had been returned as such and then carelessly reshipped to me.I did not return it as I had received Free shipping on the order in which it came.The cost to return it would have been almost as much as the item its self.I was very disappointed as I had ordered one for me and one as a gift.,0

"Kirk Woodward has closed yet another gap in the lore of America's legendary highway. Even though this book could be used by any cruiser, motorcyclists are a breed apart and therefore hold a unique perspective. Mr. Woodward has spent years travelling and absorbing the ""magic"" of Route 66, and the content of this book is a direct expression of his own special feel for the road. If you love old roads, motorcycles, or just plain travel, this is without question one of those ""gotta haves!"" In fact, buy two copies. That way you'll have one for the book shelf and one for the highway.",1
"I absolutely love this album. It rocks hard for the most part, but kicks back on occasion with songs such as Halo and Tightrope. I can't get enough of this album, and listen to it all the time. My favorites include Yours If You Like, Are You There?, Unwind, and Jimmy Shaker Day. But this is definitely a no-skip album; as in, there are no songs to skip. Brilliant from start to finish. I'm anxious to hear the lead singer's new band, Black Summer Crush, with an album due out early next year.",1

"Having picked this book up, I found that I really couldn't put it down easily. The author does a great job of slipping in the back story of the end of civilization as we know it. You keep finding out little bits and pieces of what has happened to the world and where are all of the people bit by bit. I am particularly pleased that the author chose to make his zombies, zombies and not the Carl Lewis, sprint faster than the wind zombies that were in the last Dawn of the Dead movie. These zombies shamble which is what they do quite well. Really enjoyed the building tension. A little bit bummed though that this is only part one of three. It ends on a bit of a cliff hanger but that's not going to stop me from ordering the next book in the series.",1

This 1963 and original version includes an all star cast. There is nothing but wholesome fun for the entire family. It has so much entertainment in it that it seems like you just started watching and too soon it is done. But it is a great rollercoaster ride. A must see for anyone who loves a good musical. I give it three thumbs up...so I had to borrow a thumb.,1
"I am not a fan of science fiction and so I have avoided reading Ms. Butler's work as I thought it would all be included in that genre. After co-workers and friends telling me how wonderful this book was, I decided to give it a shot. I will say that it was much better than I expected but it was not a book that I could easily zip through; some parts took some time to digest and sometimes the book did not hold my interest but I persevered and I'm glad I did.",1

It is a wonderful array of music that any country music lover would enjoy. (""Run"" and ""My Lifes Been Grand"" are my favorites at this point.) Mr Strait gets better with every album. That smooth baritone is so relaxed & gets the point across that he's still having fun recording great country music after 20+ years. He is undoubtedly the reigning King Of Country Music....Amen!P.S. She'll Leave You With A Smile is NOT, I repeat NOT the same song he recorded a few years ago.Diane",1
"This book is not about military interrogation at all, although it starts off that way. This veteran is not writing anything with any literary integrity. Instead of being about interogation, this book is mereley a blind and gross salute to the U.S military. I am ex-military myself and I love my country more than anyone but this book is more about blind praise than anything else. my advice...don't buy this book. The type of arrogance in this book is why people hate America so much",0
"I use my grinder once a week and it stopped working after about 6 months. I did grind a lot of coffee each time, but I'm still surprised it didn't last longer. I used a fine grind setting for making espresso (w/ an aeropress) and it worked fine for this purpose. Very loud too.",0
This product is a great way to get the first five and a half season on DVD. The CD zipper case which holds all the seasons is a good idea but some of the DVD's can get scratched; mine fortunately did not though. The ping pong set and poker set are a cute idea but I don't really play the games. I think this product is a bit overpriced for what you get. If you don't plan on using the Ping pong set or the poker set I would say just buy the DVD's individually.,1
Since I bought the CD yesterday it has not come out of my player. I have listened to it over and over. It seems that Hidden Beach knows how to pick talent for it's label. Those familiar with the label will not be disappointed with these artists. Their music and lyrics fit so wonderfully together and it's refreshing to hear a man sound like a man and not get caught up in the falsetto like so many other male artists today. The Kindred's voices blend so well together. I know that the comparisons of them to Ashford and Simpson will come and rightly so. If anyone feels that this CD has missed the mark then I will be very surprised.,1
"I was reluctant to see this movie, as most lesbian love story's just are not actually like the real thing.This is the first lesbian love story that really felt like falling in love is.Very sweet and beautifully done.",1
IT is actually a problem to have Coconut Pete songs. U can not find them anywhere. They were written by Kevin Heffernan (one of the writers of the movie) and performed by Bill Paxton himself. So there is NO WAY u could find them. And they DO NOT put them on soundtrack????? I dont believe this,0
"Product worked as advertised. I bought this before going on vacation to Colorado from California (1000 miles). Pulled a fifth wheel up and down some big mountains and the elevation and tracking was very helpful. I was also able to find 'gas' and food along the way real time...It worked well in the holder and acquired satellites quickly. I also use this for business and after purchasing a 2g SD card and a WIFI/256m card, it can do pretty much anything I need. Only thing I wish it had was built in WIFI...I don't use Bluetooth so that features is not being used. Overall great quality, speed is great, maps are detailed and the turn by turn was accurate..",1
Mr Leavitt's course is the best I've seen and used. Most beneficial is the fact he uses two part lessons from the beginning and all original tunes instead of familiar songs. This reinforces the need to learn how to read music and what you are learning much more efficiently than other courses I've seen.,1
"Rarely does one happen upon a sociological and economic analysis that is truly fun to read, as hard to put down as a good mystery, amusing, insightful. That is what is so amazing about I Want That. It is anthropology, and a sound analyis of why two-legged creatures have wanted to acquire since time when, and it is a real joy to read.From the author's creation of the concept of 'buyosphere' onward (and this is the same observer who created the so-Fifties and so descriptive term for that era, Populuxe), you have to sit back and enjoy his perceptive analysis of our behavior and our culture. Read it as entertainment, read it as cultural introspection. Either way, it is illuminating, thoughtful - and fun.More than worthwhile for the buying season - and after.",1
"I bought this for my wife to prevent strech marks from appearing. However, in the last month, those marks came on. I've seen in other reviews that people say you just can't prevent strech marks by applying such cream on you belly if you have the gene, though I'm not quite sure about this.",0
"Don't purchase this book for Northern Idaho.Although ""North Idaho"" is listed in the table of contents, description of these routes are VERY minimal. In fact, the opening to the chapter ""North Idaho Paddling Trips"" they reference the book ""Paddle Routes of the Inland Northwest"" by Landers and Hansen. This book ""Guide to Idaho"" even states ""If you're planning on doing some northern paddling, you'll want to have their book""Don't purchase this for northern idaho.",0
Random Passage is a sweeping history of the settling of Newfoundland's outports. The author provides a gripping picture of the harsh life that faced the early European settlers. The characters are well-developed and very real. This book is hard to put down!,1

"I have been using MySQL for years and it's easy to get by with the basic SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements. Recently I discovered the powers of JOIN statements and realized how much more was possible. I have only read a few chapters of this but I'm already impressed. It's just what I wanted because it gives you the syntax and gritty details of each feature without getting tedious and turning into a 1000 page reference manual.I can already tell I'm going to be poking around this book for years to come. I think this does a great job of filling in the gaps for someone who can already write a basic SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT statement but is looking for more. Seems good from a new user perspective too but if you haven't at least looked at some online tutorials and tested some basic statements for yourself then I would recommend doing that and then reading this book immediately afterward.",1
"Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.",1
"I had only had this camera for four months, and when I turned it on to take a picture, the viewing screen was all shattered. I was baffled because I didn't drop it and nothing had happened that would have caused that. I assumed it would be fixed under the one-year warranty, and when I shipped it back to be serviced by Canon, they had the nerve to tell me that it was my fault the screen was broken and I would have to pay $110 to fix it. When I asked to speak to a manager, the best he could do was offer to take 50% off my repair bill. I was furious, I did nothing to this camera, and was not going to pay a penny to have it fixed. I had a Kodak for five years and never had a problem with it!! I will NEVER buy anything from Canon again. This should not have happened to a NEW camera.!!",0
"I ordered this software on July 3rd, but was not able to download it till July 5. Imediately upon instalation it corrupted my Windows ME software. I spent 6 hours on the phone with microsoft trying everything to uninstall it with no luck. I reinstalled my system software 3 times and still can't use my computer. I have wasted an entire Saturday on this software which I bought for protection, but instead ended up with my worst computer nightmare. Amazon has no tech support number, and if this software has one I was unable to find it before it destroyed my system. Iresponsible, negligent, malicious and malevelant. I regret mightily buying this software. I should have gone to the store and bought something by Norton.Joe",0
I looked all over for a Mini Food Processor/Shredder combo. Settled for the Black and Decker MFP200T. Works well and I hope it holds up for more than a year or so. I would recommend this unit for those who lack space and those who do occasional shredding/processing.,1
I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT IT FOR LOOKS. I GOT MINE AND YES IT IS VERY VERY CUTE BUT IT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY. THE TOP OF THE CUPCAKE IS FAR TO HEAVY AND IT DOESN'T MOVE WHEN YOU SET YOUR TIMER. IT WOULD NOT MOVE MUCH AT ALL IN FACT SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A CHEAPER ONE...,0
"As one of the last important figures in 20th Century musical theatre, Tommy Tune was part of many important shows. One would hope his autobiography would include at least some insight into his performing and directing techniques -- but such is not the case here. As for his personal life, Mr. Tune shares a great deal -- but it is hard to rely on the frankness of someone who seems to change his sexual preferences as easily as most of us change clothes. And the chapter discussing the woman he wronged but refuses to name is so obvious in who it refers to that the author's sincerity rings false. Some interesting anecdotes and photos not found elsewhere, but overall a great disappointment.",0
I just received the Tutto Carra ITALIAN Version of Rafaella Carra and what a surprise! Although all the track tittles mencioned in the prodcut description at amazon are in Italian and the name Tutto Carra is Italian I ended up with the Spanish versions of her songs. Unacceptable. I am giving this one star because of the mis-represetnation and I did my homework trying to make sure that the item is the one I wished for. I love Rafaella and her songs do bring back memopries but I wanted the original italian version of her songs not the Spanish one. I will try to send this back and let amazon sort things out!Buyer beware!!!,0
I was happy to found this product on Amazon. It seems like no one is selling the perm lotion anymore. It was easy to use. I did not like the smell too much. You have to open the window when you put the lotion on your hair. The good news is you only need to have the lotion on your hair for ten minutes. My hair looks great now. I will buy this product again.,1
"The original 1960's production sounded much better. This revival adds unnecessary new songs, expanding the simple play to include new Peanuts characters such as Sally, and makes unneeded revisions to some of the original songs. Note that as usual, Amazon is still the best website for downloading the widest variety of mp3 selections at the lowest price in the shortest time.",1
"This story/video may be brilliant: we will never know. No subtitles. Why, oh why?I would always buy La Plante, but without subtitles, the British are impossible to understand. What a disappointment.At least now I am savvy enough to check out whether subtitles on Netlix. No subtitles: no purchase.",0
"This is the best knife I have ever used! Super sharp! Light and agile. Has a good curve so that you can still rock the knife. Blade is very thin and you can slice vegetables paper thin! Be very careful, because this knife is SHARP!",1
"I just bought this about a month ago. I read reviews and bought it because of a few good reviews but most because of my love for Sublime, Jack Johnson, and G. Love. I popped it in my stereo as soon as I got it and was disappointed fast. I love a CD that I can listen to the whole way thru without skipping a single song, and this definately was not one of those types. I'd much rather listen to original Submlime CD's and not imitators.Wasn't for me, but cheers to the ghost of Sublime, Jack Johnson for a great version of Badfish, and to those of you who enjoyed this CD.",0
"There are lots of shows about vampires and werewolves out this past few years. Most of the series/movies etc are fun to watch. But Being Human not only has very good actors and acting (at least I think so!), but I find it very humorous at times. Look, shows like this are meant to take your mind off every day activities. You will not and do not ponder about the meaning of life and why you are here after watching this show!! Just have fun watching it. So if you like vampires, werewolves, and ghosts, I am pretty sure you'll enjoy this series.",1
"I bought this book after I read the synopsis. However, I was really, really frustrated that all the pictures were hoax. I mean they just pasted either Elvis's head or his whole body on the pics. Even a kid can tell that the photos are not genuine. And I laughed when I saw the very young Elvis photos in the 90's sightings. He should have been in his 60's, right? Please don't waste your money!",0

"This canned tuna is wonderful. I haven't bought canned tuna packed in oil of any kind in years. I was recently in Molinari's Deli in S.F. and the owner tossed me a can of this stuff and said I'd like it. He was wrong, I love it. It's rich and smooth and not ""tinny"" at all. If drained well, there is very little olive oil on the tuna, and what there is, is high quality. It's splendid on Salad Nicoise or just plain with a little lemon juice, salt, and fresh ground pepper. I've given it as gifts, and it has been recieved very well.",1
My only disappoint is that this will not be appearing on HD DVD. Looks like I need to buy the standard DVD until 20th Century Fox comes to their senses.,1
This artist has one of the most relaxing amazing voices you could possibly ever imagine.This CD is one of my favourite CDs in my collection.,1
Sean Connery is excellent as William of Baskerville as he travels to 1327 Italy at the height of the Spanish Inquisition. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in historical events mainly dealing with the Spanish Inquisition.,1
"This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor. I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen. It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better.",0
I have several 1x8 tpi chucks and faceplates from my old lathe. This adapter has allowed me to continue to use them all. My alternative would have been to buy new faceplaces and adapters for each of my chucks.This is an excellent solution. The only downside is you loose about 2in between centers.,1
"We ordered this product because it was suggested by Consumer's Reports. We have been very disappointed. It does not hold very much water so it is always needing to be refilled, and the humidity in our room never seems to go up. A few times the humidifier just randomly starting chugging, and then started spewing water. Sometimes there will ever be puddles around it, so I am afraid to put it on the floor. Not sure if we ae just doing something wrong but it has been more trouble than its worth......",0
"I highly recommend this book. My sister lives in another stateand has dementia. I understand her depression and confusion nowthat I read ""THE 36 HOUR DAY.""",1
Do not waste your money on this toilet paper! The only reason I gave it one star was becuase it is slightly better than using your hand. 1000 sheet per roll means very little if they are as thin as onion skin. I kept thinking the layers were coming apart at first until I realized what a bad product I had purchased. Not even sure I will make my family use up the package. DONT BUY IT!!,0
I love this box set and if you are a James Bond fan who always thought about buying the dvds now is your chance to have all of them at once!,1
"I've read true crime books for almost 40 years. This ranks as the worst. Recently I've noticed ""lazy writing"" in this genre, i.e., inserting pages and pages of court transcripts. We don't want to read them. It's your job to break them down for the reader. This author goes one step further; page after page of detective interviews. She doesn't even bother to summarize these interviews. I'm still laughing at Rothgeb's ""Author's Note"". If she has read dozens of true crime books over the years she certainly didn't learn anything. As for ""writing"" a book, please stop trying now and take some lessons from Ann Rule. This lady knows how to write a true crime book and so does M. William Phelps and Gregg Olsen. I can't wait to donate this to the library. Even those this book deserves it I could never destroy a book, as bad as this one is.",0
"This CD is truly amazing. After being in the Fantasticks (I was Matt) I can say that this music is a joy to work with. El Gallo is incredibly talented and he hits certain notes so well. His monologues are quite amazing too. Matt is also very good even though he adds a lot of his own style in it. Luisa, despite her shrill voice, puts in a lot of energy. The fathers are always fun to listen to, even if there harmonies are a little off. Altogether a great CD!",1
"I found Timeline to be an amazing story, vividly portrayed as only Crichton can. Using both modern science and history, he melded both concepts into one, and created another top notch book. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.",1
"Having seen this game at E3 2004, I must say I'm very disappointed in the look and play.The game is nothing new and is really bland. The graphics are dated and look rather dull. I would not recommend this game to anyone who had bought the last one.Look out for Jak 3 or Ratchet & Clank 3, they are much better games and look a hundred times better. I played all three games and this was the boring one!Is this for real? This game looks pants. I was hoping it would be better then the last one, but in fact it's worse. The game has cut-scene after cut-scene and no real fun factor.",0
"The standard US version of this release is mysteriously OUT OF PRINT for some reason! However, this is an import version titled ""World mix"" with different cover artwork and bonus mixes and therefore is an essential item for those who cannot get a hold of a copy of the original Deep Forest albumDeep Forest came around shortly after the huge success of Enigma who combined Gregorian chants to ambient dance rhythms. Deep Forest came up with a similar concept except it was to mix Pygmy/African vocal samples with dance rhythms creating a sound all it's own. While the following Deep Forest cds have been great as well, none of them have matched the qualities and beauty found on this release and therefore it is among one of most essentials albums of the progressive world music genres of all time.",1
"Ok, face it Progress was a good album, it had promise I thought for the future of this band, but they steered another way and turned into a I wana be a punk band sound. When they first came onto the seen I found them by accident looking for something to fill my musical void since Bradley Nowel died. The hard thing is you can never replace Sublime, but progress had a somewhat similar sound to Sublime, and in some instances the vocals kind of reminded me allot of Sublime. I was hoping that this album would follow that sound they had and improve on it, but..... well in my opinion they might as well be Good Charlotte now, and god I hate that band! . Oh well, by the way to anyone else who was a big Sublime fan like me, you might want to check out Slightly Stooped Acoustic roots, and Dispatch. Two good bands.",0
"The is the worst monitor we have ever bought. The lifespan only lasts about 4 month. When the monitor was 4 month old, the screen started going to dark when I just turned on the computer. We need to re-turn on the monitor again and again. The condition was getting worse, finally even you re-turn on the monitor 20 times, the monitor may work one time. This product has no warranty. The product description on the Amazon says that it is made by Viewsonic, and I think that is cheating, there is no any viewsonic mark on the monitor. Don't waste you money on this product.",0

"The best invention since the computer and bread. I can't live without it. a MUST have for everyone. HOwever, TIVO charges to much for their service and they should ALWAYS offer a lifetime package instead of every now and then. HD needs to be cheaper so I will wait for that. My comcast box takes care of my HD programs.",1
"Although I've been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction for decades, I'm not that taken with the zombie side of the genre. Lately, that means slim pickings. Zombies are big nowadays. Really big. That said, I didn't avoid this book because of zombies, but because of the Kindle price and the fact that the story is presented in the form of a journal. I had a weak moment though, and got the Kindle version anyway. I'm glad I did. It's a great story, and the journal has a realistic bent to it, through various asides, but not so much that it distracts from the story. A fun, gripping read.",1
"Quality of the individual parts was good. However, the locking mechanism that prevents the winch from slipping in the opposite direction has a weak return spring, and isn't quite lined up with the gear. As a result, it does not lock consistently. Avoid this product if you need a working locking mechanism.I live in Hawaii, so return shipping is not worth the expense and hassle. It's a good size for throwing at the wild pig that visits in my yard at night. Don't need a working locking mechanism for that.",0
"If you are going to redo a redone.. Do it right. While the Queen was pretty evil, everyone else was so so. Even the effects got watered down by the dry acting. Can we do a another princess please?

"This is not really multiplayer. You cannot connect other 360's and play multiplayers and you cannot play more than one player per box on Xbox Live. This is Microsoft trying to maximize profit at the expense of increasing game players. They want to sell an Xbox, game and controller to every person that you want to play with.It is a great single player game, but only for about 3 days. By then you have beat all the levels and, since you can't get your friends into a game, you are done with it.It seems that Microsoft does not like the way that Halo allowed all your friends to play at once with you.",0
"I ordered this product because I was desperate and rushed to have it delivered. The battery is no good despite this being a ""new"" package. Customer service at Pet Safe told me that they would send me new batteries - in 7 to 10 business days. I asked the rep if that was the best she could do considering they sold me a faulty product and I should not have to wait another two weeks to get the issue addressed. Her response was that for an additional $15 they could expedite it to me. Disgusting!!! I should pay $15 to correct their faulty manufacturing/quality control???",0

It could be me though; maybe I'm ""earphone challenged"", but I have a heck of a time getting these coordinated in my ears, they don't fit comfortably and after I do get them in, then the disappointment of listening to my music begins.

Oh well...(sigh), another pair of headphones relegated to the ""only in an emergency"" drawer! And thus, my search for good, durable, user-friendly earphones continues ...",0
"I was a little nervous buying this costume because of some of the reviews, but I went ahead and purchased it anyway. And I'm glad I did! My son, who was 7 months old and 18 lbs at the time, fit into this perfectly. The hole for the face stretches quite a bit, so no worries. And yes, the red bleeds into the white of the costume, but for only wearing it once, it was a pretty good costume! He was the perfect little tootsie roll and got rave reviews. Phew!",1
Sat down a watched the Hunger Games with my family this the first installment of many to come is a classic for tomorrow. The DVD came on time and amazon again lived up to its reputation. A great addition to my library.,1
"Bangkok is a city ripe for this sort of fictional treatment, but John Burdett apparently did not immerse himself deeply enough in Thai culture and Buddhism to pull it off for this Thai reader. There are details that would probably be appreciated by the Western reader as adding a touch of oriental mystery to the proceedings, but because the author gets them wrong, only telegraph his superficial familiarity with Thai culture. A writer who makes much more effective use of Bangkok and Thai culture as a fictional backdrop is S.P. Somtow, a horror/fantasy author who happens to be Thai. I had looked forward to Bangkok 8, but my being Thai seems to have prevented me from enjoying the book as much as most other reviewers.",0
"Just received the Sangean 3/21/09. Worked fine out of box for 10 mins and then abruptly malfunctioned, producing only static on all bands and stations. Tried various headphones to no avail. Appears to have been a short of some kind. Too bad because it looked and sounded promising. Well designed and the deep base and stereo functions worked as advertised. Sound was good with the supplied headphones. While there was no opportunity for thorough testing, it appeared to be somewhat fragile. Not sure it would have held up to regular transport in a gym bag. Maybe it was just a lemon. Trying a Sony walkman and if that comes up short may give another Sangean model a try, and would lean toward an older version with slightly more heft.",0
This book has a unique point of view on what Orishas are and their different powers and manifestations.You will never perceive the Orisha/Santeria/Lukumi community in the same way after reading this book. It will open your eyes to the beauty of Orisha.,1

"Not only are the visuals beautifuly presented, the two main stars are great on the eyes. Nicole Kidman looks and sounds spectacular, the same can be said for Ewan Mcgregor who has a great boyish charm about him. The chemistry between the stars is wonderful and the songs make you want to get up and dance. Overall a very enterntaining and beautiful love story. Im sure I will be watching it numerous times.",1
This toy was difficult to set up and we were not able to make it work for more than a minute at a time. I would not recommend it.,0
Ther's not alot to say about this book. The book was just to boring to deserve a better grade. All of s.d.perrys books were awsome of course exept for caliban cove. Mrs perry just failed to keep me exited unlike her other resident evil books.the descriptions were not as efective as the others. The story itself was pretty bad. I mean zombies with machine guns come on. They can hardly walk on there own legs how are they going to use machine guns. Even though it is the worst book in the series you should still read it to follow along with the series.,0
The product did not come when stated. Only after my requesting info did I recieve an update as to delivery date status. I finally recieved it a week later.,0
"Tripe. It is difficult for me to understand the influence that such uneducated, and indeed dangerous, teachings such as Tenny can have over many Christians. For Tenny, Chasing God is not the development of a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship of God to Man. Rather, to be a 'God Chaser' is to be someone with an unhealthy addiction to the emotive experiences that are often associated with the Holy Spirit. I like to call this 'Rock Concert Christianity.' In fact, most of the same results that Tenny suggests you should see through Chasing God can be had by attending a particularly good performance by U2. But what makes this a truly terrible book is that Tenny claims, as so many other misguided preachers, the authority of Almighty God. In this, Tenny is unforgivable. Ministers of God should consider with greater seriousness the consequences of their teachings. Tenny sounds good to modern, Veggie-Taled, Christians. This is not a good thing.",0

"I loved this movie as a kid. And I couldn't wait to have my daughter watch it as well...and she does! The movie is cheesy, silly songs that get stuck in your head all day but I LOVE it. And it can't beat the quality time my daughter and I have together watching it. I guess I feel the same as my mom did when she watched it with me.",1
"Although it contained some things I would have prefered were left out, I find this to be a very touching, and inspiring story.It really showed how when you put things in perspective, things tend to work out. I liked this story, because it shows that good things can come from bad situations if you just let it, and do what you can to make it work out for the best, even if it does mean giving something less important up.",1
"I just recently viewed this movie again. I enjoy it more each time. I like action movies and expect to be entertained. The action of this movie and the theme of good over evil adds to the enjoyment of this movie. Some people are not only offended by the portrayal of how the Viet Cong treated our soldiers, but refuse to believe such war attrocities occurred.. Some pretty awful tortures were performed in this movie involving fire, rats and even Viet Cong whores being used to torture and humiliate the POWs. This is not for the squeamish who know nothing about war. But if you like action movies, this one is great.",1
"I was so excited to finally get the final season, to finally complete my set. THEN IT ARRIVED! I was extremely disappointed! Bad color, short commentaries, the bloopers were a repeat (AND SHORT!).

"It makes great, fast coffee although it is a little loud during brewing. Sight glass would be nice, but at this price I can't argue.",1
"I should have known the price was way to low. Looks like they are trying to unload these on the uninformed consumer. It is my fault for assuming that this would play on my Blu Ray player, now I know better. So, if you do not have the HD player, don't even bother with this DVD.",0
"We purchased this for our 16 month old. We had the three-in-one swing to toddler chair for our older children, but they stopped making it, so this was the next best thing. This chair has a very cute pattern and is a nice comfortable chair. Our child seems to really like sitting in it.",1
"The paper towel holder was much too small for the large size Bounty rolls I buy from places such as Costco. Ditto for the plastic wrap holder. Appears to have been designed with much smaller European-sized products in mind.Also the item is not easily drilled into the wall as the screw holes are stupidly placed in one of the smaller roll holders, making it impossible to fit a drill into that space and very difficult to fit even a screwdriver without cutting your hand along the metal teeth. A shockingly expensive disappointment.",0
"I got this mower for myself. My husband uses the gas-powered mulching mower, and I use this one to help him cut some of the lawn. He has really appreciated it especially when it starts to rain; we can both hurry and get the grass cut sooner! The mower cuts very well; not the crisp cut that the mulching mower gives, but then again it is a reel mower. My other reason for getting it was the lack of mower noise and for the exercise.",1
"Details:I can't get these to work. I have warmed with my palms and then molded with my fingers. They just won't fit in my ear.The wax starts out as a hard little ball surrounded by cotton. The directions tell me to unwrap wax. Not all of it come off, but I am not worried. Then, i am supposed to warm the wax in my very clean fingers. After the wax is malleable enough, I am supposed to shape it to fit in my auditory canal.Uh. Okay.So, I try to mold. Doesn't work. Then I try to push in and spread the wax so it covers the opening of my auditory canal. No good. Finally, I smush the two together to make a normal-sized wax earplug. Nope.Ironically, or maybe just sadly, there is a truck outside blasting music - I could sing along if I listened to bad music - and I can't get my earplugs to stay in my auditory canals so I am up writing this review.",0
"Remember the grammar rules you learned as a kid? This book states these rules in a simple, straightforward manner. Then if you still don't understand a rule, it gives specific examples. It also takes you through writing a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, and on up through writing papers and reports and more. There's even an appendix with additional helpful hints. This is a book that's good for all ages.",1
I love my circulon w/Colander - I also have the larger stock pot w/locking lid. I highly recommend this one for veggies. I'm so sick of lossing my veggies when trying to drain the water or pulling out a seperate colander.,1
"I ordered this piece pretty cheap off of here, it was pretty inexpensive I cant remember for sure but I want to say it was under $7 with shipping. It did arrive in decent time, how ever when I got it- Immediately noted that it didn't have a name ore any kind of branding on it, It was slightly miss-shaped and not symmetrical. With my heart already sinking, I connected it to my laptop and then to my external monitor. (Both of which (port and monitor) work perfectly). Upon turning on the monitor how ever, I could see my background, but before I could even be happy the screen on my external monitor started jumping and flickering, and doing so with such frequency that nothing was readable. However when I plugged my T.V. into the same port (getting rid of the adapter) I never have any problems. THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK!!!!! I DIDN'T SPEND MUCH ON IT BUT STILL FEEL THAT WAS MONEY THOROUGHLY WASTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"This is the only scholarly work I have written by HG Wells and I regret it. We can forgive him the inaccuracies of the natural history section of this book. We have 90 years of scientific advancement since them and it's accurate enough for what thre information avilable at the time.I will also grant that I learned a great deal about the orgins of different nationalities by tribe in Europe. How many peopl actually know that Russians were decended from Vikings? Certainly not me.No, the tough part to get through was the upper class English snobbery. I can't tell you how many times I read the words ""brown people"" and ""savages""...ugh.Stick to Wells' fiction.",0
"The Stevie Wonder of the early 70s was a true innovator and musical genius. The post-""Hotter Than July"" Stevie Wonder turned out far too much MOR and soundtrack pablum. Unfortunately this set relies too heavily on his 80s and 90s output. Skip it and buy a copy of ""Innervisions""",0
this is the best metal church cd since blessing in disguise hands down classic form tigth music and musicals in great form.this has all the classic metal church sighs and sound a shame they can't get this on the other 6 newer cds.,1
"I have 15 inch Beagle puppy from field stock, I needed something to block him from going through a 5 foot wide arch way into the living room. This did the trick, until he got full grown (six months). Short of putting up a chain link fence in your house this will work.",1
"I am junior student in Istanbul University . My major branch stand as PC-Based Computer Engineering so I had to learn something cool gives me the ability to deal with fill-in forms over the Web . I can say it is the most simple book explains the basics of arguments , functions , and CGI programming under Perl . Note: Almostly everything can be done with Java also possible with least code , short time and effort . Notice that Perl Language stand as a Platform independent . Simple , powerful , and strong way to learn it achieved by buying this book .",1
"This litle pink sponge is amazing! I didn't know what the hype was all about, but it is worth every penny! You simply dampen the sponge, and it applies your foundation very smoothly & evenly, espcially around the eyes...it's easy to get in the corners. The cleanser is worth it...it really cleans out the sponge of old makeup and keeps it fresh, rinsing with just soap & water didn't do the trick.",1
"This book is a great book. It is for the more advanced spiritual seeker. It takes time to read and you really need to understand what is being conveyed. However, I HIGHLY recommend it.",1
"First off let me start by saying I that love the Simpsons. I have not yet gotten to see this season, so I can't comment the episodes themselves. However I did buy Season 11 and this season is packaged the same way. You have to slide the disks in and out of the cardboard causing scratches to the disks and occasionally jamming a disk in the casing causing further damage to the disk. I would strongly caution would be buyers to heed this warning and check out the episodes by getting them from the library.If you do buy it- I would advise storing the disks elsewhere, unless you want to end up with scratched disks that you can't watch and have to buy another copy. I'm curious what Fox is thinking? Its probably cheaper for them to package them this way (while still charging normal prices),but at our grief. Hopefully other fans will make voice this sentiment otherwise the future seasons will probably be packaged the same way (fox studios phone # 310-369-1000).",0
"I have two major complaints about this product. Firstly, the grinder is ""preset to a medium grind"". Well, I found it to be much coarser than the way I do it in my grinder so I have to use almost twice as many beans to get the same strength brew. At $11.99 per pound, that is not a good thing so I now disable the grind function and do it myself just like before. Secondly, the coffee doesn't get hot enough, even when using the heat-boosting ""1-4 Cup"" button. I have $150 coffeemaker and yet I grind my own beans and then have to microwave my coffee before drinking it. Thumbs down.",0

The chair itself is reasonably comfortable but the foot rest bar is in the way when getting in or out of the chair and is hard on bare feet. When the chair is reclined the foot rest bar is uncomfortable unless wearing shoes. I have had to end up using a separate footstool.Also the instructions say that the straps supporting the seat and back are not under warranty and should be replaced every two years! Thre is no mention as to how to obtain the new straps. I feel this information should be included in the product description. I would not buy another one.,0

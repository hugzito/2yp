"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More",1
This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.,1
"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!",1
"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More",1
"Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception.",1
I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.,1
"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly.",1

"Stayed here for Thanksgiving and had the best experience. Before we arrived they asked my three year old little boy's name and when we arrived they had the most adorable kids travel pillow and personalized cookie waiting for him.

This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready!

"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service.

"This property is absolutely pristine. The grounds are perfectly maintained, the rooms are luxurious with exquisite detail and the hotel in general is just a site to see. The location is great if you want to be away from the city and in a quiet area with gorgeous views of the hills (but close enough to to drive to Del... More",1
"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!",1
"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend.",1
"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",1
"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience. Were glad you enjoyed our close proximity to our famous Kuhio Beach, restaurants, shopping outlets, and tourist attractions We are dedicated to touch all we encounter with integrity and the gracious spirit of Aloha as we fulfill the dreams of our guest. Overall we hope you had a positive experience on Oahu, and enjoy all the adventure our island has to offer. If your travels bring you back to Waikiki, we would be delighted to host you again. Mahalo,Thomas Harris Jr. General Manager",1
"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.",1
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",1
"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!",1
"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",1
"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager",1
"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures!

"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home. We will share with our team your praises and we are thankful for your visit. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1

"I love the location, the staff, the restaurants, THE BAR, the rooms and all of the extra services that are offered here where staff remember so many little details about previous trips that each return is like an extended day from the last stay.",1
"Amazing hotel, great service . They make you feel like you are their main concern . The rooms are amazing very clean, and equipped with every thing.

"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends",1
"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",0
"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray",1
"We took a break from shopping and treated ourselves to a cocktail in the famous King Cole bar at the St Regis. Great experience, it was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy our drinks and have a chat with Mathias - who made our visit a fun experience.Can certainly recommend and will try to return before we head back to England!Dear grarus, Thank you for visiting our King Cole Bar, the home of The Bloody Mary and Maxfield Parrish Art Nouveau masterpiece the mural behind the King Cole Bar. We are thrilled you enjoyed your drinks. We hope you have a chance to visit again before your trip back to Europe. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"Stopped in for mimosas and coffee while shopping in 5th Avenue. Where else can you get a Veuve Cliquot Mimosa Beautiful, nostalgic, old world.

We are pleased that you enjoyed your mimosa at our iconic King Cole Bar, and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Kindly, Senih Geray General Manager",1
"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We are very pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and especially your experience in the Athletic Club.

"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1

"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",1

"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"Just an amazing place. You are treated like a king all the time. This place has ruined me for all other hotels. I am going again this weekend and cannot wait. Maria Christine Duhon and Liubov were amazing. They took care of everything and made sure my wife and I were happy. I highly recommend the St Regis.Dear da0987654321, Thank you for your recent review on TripAdvisor. We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience, and we are so pleased that you had a wonderful visit at The St. Regis New York.

"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",1
"We enjoyed our lunch at the St. Regis. From the service to the food and drink, everything was impeccable. The setting is classic and polished, comfortable and beautiful. It was our first time at the St. Regis and we will return. Highly recommended.Dear mnkittycat, Thank you so much for having lunch at The St. Regis New York. We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"I have never been so impressed with the customer service of a hotel. Every single staff member went above-and-beyond to make us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel. I have traveled all over the world, and have never been more impressed with the level of hospitality provided at the St. Regis in NYC.Dear Julie D, A complimentary review such as yours is always welcomed. Thank you for taking the time to post your comments on TripAdvisor. I sincerely look forward to welcoming you back to The St. Regis Hotel New York in the not-so-distant future.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We will share your kind words with our staff, and we are so grateful for your support!We look forward to welcoming you back to New York soon! Kindly, Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge",1
"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",1
"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.",0
Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More,0
Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small.,1
"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Very clean and comfortable rooms. Kitchenette included in the room. All staff was friendly and helpful. Great lobby and an excellent breakfast. Wonderful location, right across from the Philadelphia convention center and Reading Market. The Southeast Pennsylvania Regional Transit Association rail terminal and train to the airport is next to the Reading Terminal. Easy walk to Independence Mall. Lots of shopping and eating nearby.",1
"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Nice hotel with an excellent location. Large, modern rooms. Nice facilities and great internet connection. I remove one star because housekeeping service is on request only during the weekends. This is an obvious cost saving measure, but is a inconvenience for those only staying over a weekend. I hope Hilton reexamines this policy as it's really silly and no doubt... More",1
"Across from reading terminal. Very close to convention center. Parking next door. New rooms well decorated and very spacious. Large bathroom.

"I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and highly accommodating. The hotel is clean. The food market located directly across the street is very interesting and they have anything you could possibly be craving.

"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again.",1
Rooms are a bit small but you are in Chicago and don't spend much time in the room. Everything was very clean. Location was excellent. Close to restaurants and attractions. Pillows were wonderful. Fresh water and bottles available on each floor. Coffee and snacks in lounge morning and evening,1
"This is a good hotel for business purposes. The wi fi signal is good and it is very close to the federal reserve bank. A little too close to some of Chicago's high crime district for my taste, but we felt relatively safe. Convenient to restaurants, and decent breakfast. A solid business option.Dear Samantha HThank you for your review.I would like to reassure you that The Central Loop area of Chicago which is, as you know, also the Financial District of the City is not near any major crime area. The area is safe and very well patrolled by the Chicago Police so please do not have any concerns.I am glad you had a good stay with us and look forward to you return.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager",1
"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!",1
"The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location.",1
"This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better.",0
"I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located.",1
"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.",1
"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager",1
"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!",1
As a visitor from the UK I was given all the help possible to enable me to get around the city in the short time that I had available. The rooms were all that I could have wished for. I arrived before check in time but that was no problemDear jameswZ268okbI am glad that we were there to help you enjoy this great city. I am also delighted that you enjoyed our rooms.Please do come back and see us again - this city still has lots more to seeRegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager,1
"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.",1
"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.",1
"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,",1
"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future.",1
"We arrived around noon and check-in was not until 4 pm and they gave us room immediately. The room was very large and clean with a balcony. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property. Hope to see you on your 2nd trip to Napa.",1
"Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again.",1
"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.",0

Will go back for sure, price is decent considering the area.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We are here to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We will see you the next time your in the area.",1
"We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!",1
Our stay was perfect. The room was immaculate and location was great.The people at the front desk were so accommodating and helpful.We arrived early and they got us a room before check in time.They gave helpful restaurant choices as well!!Hey Dianne! We are happy you enjoyed your stay! Please come back and see us again! Cheers!,1
"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales",1
Convenient location on edge of Napa...rooms appeared to be recently renovated and were well appointed. Staff was extremely pleasant. Rates were competitive...free breakfast next door for BW Gold Crowne members.Rainier66 - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again in the future.,1
"The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley. A very solid choice if you want a slightly cheaper option and don't mind not staying in a farmhouse!Thank you for your review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!",1
"Inn at the Vines is always a great stay in Napa Vallley. Good rooms and nice, friendly employees make this a wonderful stay. Great price/value! We dont use the free breakfast at Dennys but still nice that is included. Good location for visiting wine country.",1
"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"We've stayed at this hotel for the last 4 years to attend the Napa Valley Jazz Getaway. Always a good experience. Great stay, attentive staff and nice treat to have free breakfast at Denny's! Will stay there again.",1
"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!",1
"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!",1
"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again.",1
My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October. Make sure to ask for me when you arrive and I will make sure to have more suggestions for you.,1
"Comfortable beds, nice pool and hot tub. Computer room very handy since I didn't bring a laptop or iphone. Good fitness center. Great bonus was a coupon for a free full breakfast at next door's Denny's.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay!",1
"Gorgeous sheets and comfy beds, flat screen TV. The room was nice and quiet. Great location to visit key areas of Napa and very close to downtown . Staff was very friendly. The only thing we missed was a safe in our room. Reasonable prices for July.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay. Come back and see us again.",1
"Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town.",1
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines on our trip to Napa. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a very helpful front desk clerk who made sure we had everything we needed. The rooms we clean and very nice. Overall I'd give this hotel a 100 and I'd definitely come again!Ronda S,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Come back soon !",1
"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon. Genafer, Director of Sales",1
"Great hotel! If you are going on the Winetrain in Napa, it is conveniently located 5 - 6 minutes away and is a very safe, clean and comfortable place to stay. Only problem we had was the shower water temperature was difficult to set and maintain! Hopefully they may be able to fix this minor problem!",1
"Great central location for exploring downtown Napa and the Napa Valley. Good access from HWY 29, HWY 12, and HWY 128. There are plenty of much more expensive choices in the Napa area, but saving a few on lodging allows for stretching for great local food and wine.Thank you for your review and I am glad we were a great place to stop on your visit to the Napa Valley. We aim to be the best value for your in Napa. Hope to see you again in the near future.",1
"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa.",1
"The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon.",1
My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible.,1
The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again.,1
"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.",1
"Great location in Napa, CA. Check in was very good. Nice breakfast at Denny's. Room very clean, everything in working order. Upgraded because of my Diamond status. I will stay here again!! Nice restaurants in the area, downtown area.Debra, we are glad you had an enjoyable stay. Thank you for being a Diamond member of Best Western Rewards, we appriciate it. Rewards has it's perks, free upgrades, hot breakfast at Dennys, early check in and late check out when available. Come back and see us again.",1
"This hotel on the outskirts of Napa Valley provided an excellent base to tour this area. The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests. They provided us with a lot of options for our stay and were so friendly and informative. We would recommend this hotel purely on the standard of the reception staff.Dear 185robynp,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so pleased you enjoyed our stay and our staff was able to help you with your plans around the valley. We hope to see you again soon. Cheers, Genafer",1
"VERY clean, comfortable place to stay located near downtown Napa. The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else. But you'll probably have to pay more.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.",1
"It is always the staff experience that provides to customers that's why I like staying at Best Western in Napa. They always do an extra mile and never forget to smile, even the housekeeping they are very polite and always with a smile when they greet you.Armandmariano C - Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review. I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales",1
"As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!",1
"Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again.",1
On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.,1
"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.",0
The maids were very helpful room was excellent! Melinda at the front desk was terrific too! As I had stated I needed to check in earlier than 4pm mu room wasn't ready I had to wait an hour and a half.,1
"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.",1
"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.",1
"Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!",1
"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns.",1
"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Cheers, Genafer",1
"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away.",1
"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again.",1
"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",0
"We had a wonderful time. Aloft was beautiful. The staff helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the amenities were very good. The beds were very comfortable. The location was really good for getting around the city.Doesn't get much better than that! Thank you for your kind words and we look forward to your next visit, Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
"Last minute trip to enjoy Christmas break. Location was great for walking everywhere. Went to a football and basketball game. The hotel staff is amazing. Scott was helpful all weekend. The rest of the staff were friendly, outgoing, and very knowledgeable about the area.That's what we like to hear!! Scott will be thrilled to hear he made an impact. Thanks for staying and we hope to see you again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well. I wish bathroom had better privacy and ventilation.Location : fantastic, close to all attractions.Restaurant : I didnot try, so I don't know.Overall: nice experience , will be back.Happy to hear your enjoyed your stay overall and will be back we look forward to it!! Sorry about the delay getting you checked in, while we do our best to schedule according to our needs we occasionally run into unexpected busy periods. We will be sure to keep that under our radar.See you again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Great vision combined with high energy ,pushing hospitality into a my first stay in this aloft brand . Rates were reasonable. Location was great. Clean room. Large shower . Comfortable bed. Pet friendly. Other than thin walls , was pleased with Staff, modern theme, large clean room and shower area. Great! We have converted another happy guest and we are so glad that you gave us the chance. Thanks for trying out Aloft New Orleans Downtown.",1
The rooms were very nice and spacious! The workers were friendly and very calm even though it was a big event going on in the city. The rooms were very clean and comfy beds. I enjoyed my stay overall.Clean and comfy is music to our ears. Thanks for the great review and we hope you get back to Aloft New Orleans Downtown!,1
"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!",1
"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately. Rest assured we will address each item with our team for immediate correction. It was disheartening that your first visit with us was disappointing.I truly would love to have the opportunity to have you back as our guest and show you our true service standards. Would you be willing to visit us again Please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com to discuss.",0
"They have great staff, pet friendly, rooms impecable, the coffee in the lobby really good and free, the lobby bar very enjoyable, perfect location, just the car parking should be more flexible and less expensive.We are thrilled to hear of your great experience! Ill be sure to share your feedback with our staff. Thanks for staying, we hope to see you in the future, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"This property reminds me of being in northern europe. (esp. Sweden and Danmark) Very modern, few frills, and everything clean and useful. We did have our A/C unit go out, and they responded within minutes. When it happened the next day again....they just gave us a new room. Their problem-solving skills exceeded my expectations. A good team with a good system.Our staff will be thankful for your kind words while we hate you had an issue, we are glad we were able to correct that issue and you were able to enjoy the remainder of your stay. Thanks so much for staying and see you again next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Great location a block off canal and just outside French quarter, very nice rooms, spacious, not much privacy in bathroom space and somewhat see through shower glass pane into main room. Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi",1
"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",1
"This hotel is just two block to Bourbon Street and close enough to walk alway to Cafe DuMonde. Safe area. Bed very comfortable and hotel perfectly clean and nice. I will stay here again every time I am in NOLA. LaQuinta rates for Sheraton level hotel. Great value at great prices, what a winner! Thanks so much for staying with us at Aloft New Orleans Downtown and taking the to post your review. Come back soon.",1
"Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you. We hope we have another opportunity to earn your business back please reach out to me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com or 504-312-7715.I hope to hear from you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",0
"I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty.

"Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share.",1
"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1
"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown.",1
"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager",1
"New hotel, the rooms the lobby you notice that this is a new building. It was very clean, we enjoyed our room and the lobby.Staff was all friendly and the breakfast was good (usual Hampton Inn breakfast).Dear bens9,Thank you for your raving review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Great to hear you enjoyed our Hampton breakfast as well as our friendly staff. We hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
"We were lucky to be one the first guest at this brand new hotel in Napa , we were Very satisfied. The staff although new they tried to do their best. Now when I travel I always check if Hampton inn hotel is near by .",1
"Nice New Hampton Hotel. Rooms were very clean, Comfy Beds. Close to walking paths and down town Napa. Staff was friendly ! Great place to stay. Walking paths along the Napa River make it nice way to start the day.Dear Paul O,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our comfy beds and that you we're able to take advantage of our walking path that runs along the river just behind the hotel. We look forward to serving you again in the near future. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in.,1
"This is a newer place, clean and friendly service. For the business traveler this is great, one of the more economically friendly hotels in Napa. The location is good too, easy on and off and not far far from downtown. I slept great, nice clean comfortable bed. Overall really nice. Dear JimWard99,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your feedback on our clean and friendly service. Thank you again for taking the time to review, Serina Najar.",1
"The staff is all very friendly, and facility was great! Over all a great experience. Everything for a family Vacation. Also there is a cute little farmers market and movie theater, and restaurants nearby.",1
"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!",1
Beautiful brand new hotel. The staff performs at 110. Great location everything you need is within 5 miles of this hotel. Comfortable room great service overperforming staff makes this hotel the best place to stay in Napa.,1
"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar.",1
"Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar.",1
"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar.",0
"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.",1
"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car.",1
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar.",1
"I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar.",1
"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
"Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1
"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat.",1
"We stayed with my family for 1 week.It was amazing time for relax in Dubai,especially in Marriott Marquis.Restaurants food are delicious,especially we recommend Izakaya and Garden.Cafe Artois is fantastic place with very nice view to Dubai Canal.Service of concierge Mustafa was super.He advised my family all iconic places of Dubai.Definitely we will be back soonWe want to thank you for staying at the Fairfield Inn Suites by Marriott Keys Collection and we are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay, your patronage is very important, and it means the world to us that you had a great stay.",1
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends.",1
"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us.",1
"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1
Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!,1
"The folks here have paid attention to detail and made this a wonderful place to stay. There is Plenty of room for parking, a nice breakfast, comfortable rooms, easy check in and out. The Great location makes it easy enough to get around without being to close to downtown.Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed your visit.Thanks you for staying with us, hope to see you again soon.",1
"The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.Dear Ashley663,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us. We hope you had a relaxing time here in Key West and we hope to see you back in again soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1
"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!",1
"I had looked into Villa Toscana before but it was completely full. Last week I lucked out. The location was convenient, the room was comfortable, the innkeeper helpful and the overall experience excellent. Definitely a place I would stay again.",1
"My family and I stayed here for a night, the front desk guy and girl that were there are super nice they treated us with a warm smile and made us feel at home! . Awesome customer service and also the breakfast that they had was very good as well and our bed was very comfortable and clean as well as the room. Everyone working there was very friendly .",1
This is a great place to stay to sleep. Thats what I was looking for. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean. Older hotel but updated. Can be loud as this is a motel. I felt very safe. Parking is easy. Good value for the money.,1
"Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there. Thank you for a great stay.We are so glad our staff was able to make your time at WoodSpring Suites a great one. The WoodSpring Suites team strives to make your stay one you wont forget.

"My wife had a birthday party at theHoliday Inn North Phoenix.The event we had was wonderfully planned by Phil McIlveen,the hotel's director of sales.He helped in planning a great party within our budget.Phil went above and beyond his limits to ensure that the event was successful.The staff were courteous and very ready to listen and help out wherever and whenever we needed them.We will surely have more events in the future at this location and we will send referrals to Phil.Thank you for the hospitality.George",1
Highly recommend this hotel for the proximity to downtown Atlanta. Excellent room with very good daily service. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. Not something you find in lower quality hotels.,1
"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",0
We had the most amazing stay! Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need.

I love this place when the room rates are reasonable. The entire property is very upscale and the rooms are very spacious. This hotel makes you feel like you are on vacation while you are doing business. There is a terrific bar including outdoor seating when the weather cooperates. There are also several very good restaurants just outside the back... More,1
"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",0
"The staff was really friendly and helpfull The loccation of the hotel is great cause its only two blocks from central park , two blocks from the subway and within walking distance from cafes and restaurants The building is really old and uncleen and needs reinovation NOW ! The kitchen and everything in it was too dirty to use Wifi was available only at the lobby There was an area to chill like living room on -1 but was too spooky to chill I stayed on the 4th floor , the door of my room was broken and was really difficult to open and close The room and the bathroom were old but clean enough Also the matress and pilow was too small Finaly the heat on the room was too strong and you couldn't control it so you couldn't stay in the room nor sleep",0
"In the event you are trying to beat Atlanta traffic for one night, staying at a Hampton Inn by Hilton is the perfect choice. It gave me the opportunity to get to doing a important personal task without worries about think about my normal long commute.",1
"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley",1
"We stayed for 1 night for the Pearl Jam show , great friendly staff , all the amenities you need , cool retro rooms.Awesome location, a short stroll to Pike Place Market.Will stay again on our next trip to Seattle for sure !!Hey Harry!Thanks SO SO much for the great review. It was a pleasure having the two of you stay with us and getting to chat Pearl Jam and old Seattle rock. It would be great to see you two down from BC again soon!Cheers until then,David Bayley",1
"We enjoyed a great stay at La Quinta and would stay here again for the value and proximity to the fwy! Overall, a great value for the price!! Good sized guestroom and bathroom. It was clean and quiet. And we enjoyed the variety of breakfast item's that were served buffet style!!",1
"We really enjoyed our overnight stay here. The bed was comfortable. It was clean and quiet. The location is nice and close to the freeway with a lot of food choices close by. We were able to bring our dog, too! Recommended.",1
The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix.,1
"This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!",1
"I was very pleased with my room here. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was quiet and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was good, and the seating area was spacious and clean. I found the bed comfortable. Parking area was spacious. Close to the airport. Great value for the cost.",1
"Front desk/service personnel were very friendly, room was very clean, AC unit worked very well and breakfast was one of the best of all the La Quinta's I have stayed. Highway 10 access is fast and several gas stations plus fast food restaurants are within 1/4 mile.",1
I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel was clean inside and out. There was always fresh cookie at the front desk along with a smile on the stuff person no matter who the person was behind the counter.,1
The staff made it a very enjoyable stay. After check in the front desk clerk made fresh cookies and lemonade. The rooms were very clean and fresh smelling. The breakfast was very good and fresh. Will stay on our return trip.,1
"Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.",1
"We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well.",1
my experience here at la quinta was amazing when i visited pheonix. i recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay at an affordable price. their services were great and so was the scenery and other things about th eroom and hotel.,1
"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team",0

"Linda the front desk gal was just Awesome, we would recommend this hotel for sure. Food was great for breakfast, our room was clean and the bed comfortable. The service was amazing from Linda at the front desk, to the cleaning ladies, sweet people.Dear Traveler, Thank you for posting a review. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. I will share this review with Linda and staff. Thank you mentioning Linda, she really enjoys her job. Sincerely, Vickie W.",1
"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay. The pride and dedication our hotel team takes in providing exceptional customer service to our valued guests speaks strongly to our companys core values, good service at a fair price.Thank you again for taking the time to provide your feedback and we look forward to serving you again soon!",1
"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food.",1
"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!",1
"Industrial vibe, very new. Comfortable rooms. Fair value. Good location. Other food and coffee options in walkable distance. Ate breakfast onsite two mornings -- the menu is diverse and creative with good prices.Thank you Joel! We're happy to hear you had a great stay. We hope to welcome you again in the future.",1
"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon.",1
"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.",1
"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon.",1
"The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!",1
"This hotel is a hip, slick, cool hotel and a great price! Exposed pipes and beams, funky lights, great walk in shower with a shower and mirror in the shower! The food is locally sourced and fabulous! Artwork everywhere in the hotel. Close to downtown and light rail from the airport takes you right to the front door - stay here!!!We're so happy to hear you had a great stay! Come back soon.",1
"My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!",1
"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix.",1
Great spot! Hip Chic hotel with good service. Rooms were very nice with unique steel construction. Restaurant was delicious and the location was great. Light rail stop right in front of the hotel. Highly recommend!Thank you so much! We hope to have you back soon.,1
"This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!",1
"Had a great time, amazing place. Will definitely be returning. Did some hiking while we were there and had some great food. Great Decor and very friendly people. Like I said in the title, I highly recommend this place.Hi robertrykal, Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I'm so glad to hear you had a chance to enjoy our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant Lounge! Make sure you take advantage of our great summer rates so we can see you again soon!Have a great day!",1
"I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed.",1
"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay.",1

"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.",1
For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.,1
"We were very pleased with this place. Helpful staff, big, clean, comfortable suite. 2BR suite was perfect for 2 adults 2 kids. (No breakfast, but it was a pleasant stroll to both Carl's Starbucks - can't complain!) Great deal for the - would definitely stay here again.",1
"I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",0
"We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

The two bedroom suites worked out very well for kids. Staff of hotel were very helpful. Close to Disney and other attractions. Reasonably priced.,1
"Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par . Rests assure that we are now working on the issue and trying our best to fix the problem and I would like to thank you upon bringing this matter to our attention.

"Hotel is perfectly situated for Angel's baseball games as it is within walking distance to the stadium. Free packing. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Had a two bedroom suites, which was very comfortable. Nice having a kitchenette, although we did not use it very much. Nice options at breakfast although the eating area could be a little crowded. Variety of eating options nearby.. Very good choice.Dear Harry, Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium.

"Wonderful hotel, great location, excellent staff, Front Desk is just fabulous, and all facilities are good. This would be the ideal place for the family when they visit Disney.

"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff.",1
"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend.",1
"The owner of The Hotel Storyville went above and beyond to help us put on a birthday party in the garden. The evening was a great success. The rooms were clean and well-furnished, and the location can't be beat.",1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us.",1
"The location for this hotel is great right in the middle of the North End and close walking distance to Faneuil Hall, etc. modern efficient with large TV and electric fireplace. Very nice bathroom with standup shower but lacking in horizontal surfaces for toiletries.",1
Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city.,1
"Great location, beautiful decor. The lobby Sazerac bar is extremely popular and claims to be the birthPlace of its namesake drink. Note to older folks: The old bathroom tubs are extremely difficult to get into and out of to shower.",1
"If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!",1
"Beautiful mansion, always wanted to stay there. Could you use some improvements on the building. Definitely need new mattresses - ours was lumpy and worn out feeling. Beautiful antiques, wonderful staff - very friendly and helpful. Ideal location in the quarter.",1
We had an amazing time at the Cornstalk Hotel. Ms.Sharon was wonderful. The hotel is a lovely old New Orleans style. It's cozy and romantic. I look forward to going back for another visit. We went for our 25th Anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it extra special. Thank you!,1
One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff.,1
"I loved my stay at Cornstalk. The atmosphere is very family-like and personal. Shay was amazing, made cookies and made me feel like family. The big chain hotels can't compete with how the Cornstalk Hotel makes you feel at home, even when your thousands of miles away from home.",1
"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.",1
"The staff is outstanding, and they helped us with directions and where to go for awesome food, etc. Rooms are large and clean. Pool is very nice, and it's located just close enough to the French Quarter to have fun but also sleep in a nice, quiet hotel when you've had enough fun! Loved this place!!",1
"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.",1
Pontchartrain Hotel has friendly service and guest rooms that are beautifully appointed to the smallest detail to ensure luxury and comfort. The beds are lavishly comfy the bedding luxurious.

"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it.

"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business.",0
"I booked this room for a concert my husband and I went to. We only needed the room one night but opted for the king suite. Rooms was great, breakfast was willing. You have to walk a little to get to places but if we could do it in the frigid AC air, anyone can. Highly reccomend!",1

"This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST.",0
"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby.",1
"The hotel did not seem like it was in a good neighbourhood but the rooms were nice and comfortable. Breakfast was good but served in plastic plates and cutlery. The breakfast buffet had a nice choice of food, yoghurts and similar. The check in was easy and fast, staff was nice.",1
"The outside of the hotel is not the most inviting. However, the rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. Other reviews say this hotel is not in the best area. No area of Atlantic City is really considered a great area in my opinion so don't let that dissuade you from staying at this hotel.",1
"spacious, clean room, relatively close to boardwalk, a 7eleven across the street... not prime location (you feel that Atlantic city is not in its best days), but good value (even with the charges for parking) as it is walking distance to boardwalk/beach and the room is nice",1
"The rooms were comfy and big. Not many minutes from the boardwalk or city centre. On the negative side the surrounding area is a bit gritty, but that is a AC problem, so you really cant blame the hotel.",1

"Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review.

"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans.

"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"Close to parade routes, walking distance to the French Quarter but not in the middle of it it! Nice roof top bar and pool and view of the New Orelans areas. Would definitely stay hear again when New Orleans.",1
"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",0
"We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for the LSU game at the Dome. It was a wonderful surprise! It was an easy walk to the Dome from the hotel. The hotel was beautiful! Our room and the bed was fantastic! The staff couldnt have been nicer or more accommodating! We couldnt have been more pleased. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to The Big Easy!!Thank you for choosing NOPSI! It's a pleasure to learn the numerous things that made your time with us unforgettable. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1
"Exceed my expectation! The place was amazing. The rooms were very clean, hotel employees were extraordinarily kind. They answered all questions and directed us to the some great local places. I will definitely stay here again.Our goal is to exceed the expectations of our guests, it's always exciting to read when our guests tell us we did. Thank you for recognizing all the efforts of the team, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager",1
"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards",1
"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,",0
"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager",1
"Wonderful hotel located in the heart of the quarters. Walking distance to everything, drinks as you walk out of the hotel lobby, friendly staff. Enjoyed my Mardi Gras experience by staying here... ...Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. Mardi Gras is an amazing experience here in the Big Easy and we are excited we were able to be part of yours. We look forward to seeing you again very soon! Wayne General Manager",1
"My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time. We will be sure to share this among our team so they know their efforts did not go unnoticed and we do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this property. It was located within walking distance to Canal and Bourbon St. The only unexpected things were the price of parking and the 50 a day hold on our card. The hold is refunded though.,1
"The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! My friends and I booked this hotel for my birthday trip and we would definitely stay again. It's near the heart of the city, The French Quarters, and neatly hidden at the same time.Thank you for sharing and Happy Birthday! No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager",1
"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager",1
"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager",1
"This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour. We appreciate that you took a few minutes to share your experience for others to appreciate. It's always nice to read what our guests have to say. We look forward to your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager",1
"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",1
"This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,",1
Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.,1
"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,",1
"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",1
"As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans.

Tony will be commended for doing an excellent job and we look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",1
"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon.",1
Proximity to waterfront and downtown Seattle. Room was comfortable and service was good. You can walk to Space needle from this location. Ask for a waterfront facing room. Standard breakfast and internet.,1
"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.",0
"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!",1
"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites.",1
"This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here. We pride ourselves with our staff service and hospitality, so knowing that we were able to take care of our loyal guests, like you, is an absolute delight! Can't wait to have you staying with us again whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.In hospitality,Alina C.",1
"Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. I am pleased to hear that you and your daughter had a memorable and positive experience during your stay. Should your travels bring you back to Seattle, we hope to have another opportunity to serve you. Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"Great location across the street from lake Union. Hotel and rooms have been updated, also has a bistro, convenient for meals. Tons of great restaurants in walking distance. Staff here has always been great. I'm actually here as I write this review and and have stayed here a handful of times over the past few years. Also has a below... More",1
"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable.",1
"No surprises here, a great stay at this Courtyard! We were in town for 2 days prior to boarding our cruise and we loved our stay. For two adults, a child and a senior everyone was happy. The room was clean and nice size. The view of Lake Union from our room was beautiful and the location was great! Gym, great for the stay!Food in the restaurant, served its purpose and great to be on site!Service, fantasic!Very Happy with this stay!Thank you so much for your wonderful review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us before your cruise and hope to see you next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sincerely,Rachel Packard",1
"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",1
"We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.",1
"This is my favorite Marriott property in Seattle. The location is hard to beat and the water views are worth the great sunsets and I love watching the seaplanes come and go. Many great food choices are in this area, with even more coming to Lake Union. Nice remodeled lobby and breakfast area. Staff is always super friendly and you have to love the extra points game they offer at check in. I'll be back soon!Hello TruckeeTroutTraveler,We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I am glad that we provided you with a positive and memorable experience and exceptional service. Hope to see you soon!Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. Our hotel did go through quite a few renovations and I am pleased to hear that you liked it. We hope to have another opportunity serve you whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",1
"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!",1
The hotel is new and the rooms are very nice BUTthe waiting time for the elevator in the morning can be up to 20 minthe Que for breakfast is so long and you cant even get a seatno poolrooftop is closed in winterthe free shuttle bus... you need to wait from 30-45 min for 5 min drive and 15 min walkhouse keeping do very little - room was not cleaned as expected when you call the reception it takes 5-10 min to be answered,0
"Wonderful stay! The hotel was amazing. Modern, superb location, clean and wasn't expecting a full kitchen. The staff was wonderful!! Especially Brennan!! Very helpful! Breakfast buffet is top notch! Create your own omelet!",1
"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle",1
"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!",1
"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge",1
"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge",1
"This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge",1
"Room ok ( we had queen suite) bathroom very small. Restaurant poor. Staff friendly and tried to please.Hitel well suited for my needs as near the conference centre. Hotel shuttle bus fabulous ,drives 1 mile radius around the hotel, so very convenient and easy to get to shops and restaurants.Dear EvelynK,Thank you for taking time out of your to complete a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite. Please know this is extremely important to us and we have our maintenance addressing this concern as we speak. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge",1
"I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you! Dear KaylaNGerardW,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again hopefully soon! Sincerely,Jonathan",1
"This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle. The Light Rail from Westlake Center can take you right out to Sea-Tac. We'll be back!!!Sarah P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle!

"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.",0
"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!",1
"Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.",0
"This was my fist trip to Seattle, and this hotel was in a great location. Pikes Market is about 1.5 miles away. Everything is in walking distance, or there is a shuttle that will take you up to a mile out.

"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle.

"Very close to the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Duck Tour ride. Our room was close to the Monorail track but there was not much of disturbance.

"Not pleased. Poor experience.

"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. We are so ecstatic to hear you enjoyed our fully equipped kitchen in room, morning breakfast spread, and unbeatable location next to the Space Needle.

"We couldn't be happier with our stay at Hyatt House Seattle. The front desk was so accommodating, they had recommendations for restaurants things to do, they also helped us if we needed directions to places we also wanted to visit. There was also a shuttle that we relied on to get us around, it was great! Thank you Hyatt... More",1
"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan",1
"This hotel gave us a perfect location for our short trip to Seattle. Located directly next to the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, the Monorail and Seattle Center was beyond our expectations!! They offered a shuttle to all locations within a mile and we used this many times. Clean and courteous shuttle drivers as well!",1
"Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities. Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return.",1
"Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.",1
"Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card.

"We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything.

"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time! Such great service! Rooms were very clean and well maintained with great views of the city! I will be back, thanks!Hi Michael, Thanks for the great review!! Glad we were able to help get you to work on time. Your coming back is what matters most to us!See you then!Evan",1
"Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager",1
"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!",1
Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again.,1
"We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan",1
"Very good situation in the center of Philadelphia, the beds are perfects. Our only night here was just great, the night are completly dark, which is important for us, and very quiet. John was very helpfull. Thank youCD, We appreciate the great review! Glad you got to take advantage of the blackout shades and quiet space for a restful night sleep. Hope to have you back for more than one night! Evan",1
"When we arrived, our 2-queen room had not been prepared. The staff gave us 2 1-king rooms for the first night, then moved us to a 2-queen room for the second night. They were very helpful in scheduling our move and handling our bags. Well done!Hi 429,Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!!!! Sorry we didn't have the two bed room available upon your arrival, that sometimes happens in our biz. Glad we were able to overcome and create a great experience for you. Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan",1
"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan",1

Good workMartin, Have to say, this is my favourite review of the day!! Your don't stay somewhere average... line is classic. Perhaps you should be our new pitchman! Thanks for the recognition of the good work, a lot goes into getting this right from the brand, to the design and of course the most important part the staff! Thanks for staying here and hope to have you back soon! Evan",1
"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.",1
"great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return.",1
Great place to hang and rest after doing the Key West thing. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is gorgeous! Attention to detail from the lobby to the room's bathroom. The pool area is an oasis to cool your body and enhance your soul. We plan to make this our place to stay whenever we're in Key West and can't wait to check out the one in New Orleans.

Paul the other bartenders are always so attentive. I enjoy going in and relaxing. I tell everyone I know to stop in and see how nice the Saint is. The food is good and the drink menu is fun... I tell all my friends to stop in 417 to 714 happy hour.It's a great happy hour to try all that we have to offer in food and drinks. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to seeing you soon!,1
"Clean, nice staff and wonderful pool. Great location, but because of that it's pretty noisy. The decor was not my fave, but that's not a big deal. There were little things off like no mini fridge or fan in the bathroom.Thank you for your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve our property.",1
"What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!",1
"Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay.",1
"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere. We are so glad that you found it conveniently located to everything! We hope you will come visit us again. Thank you again for your review.",1
"This perfect hotel is in the perfect location. The photos here don't do it justice. If you like trendy boutique hotels, then this is the perfect place for you to stay in Key West. We loved everything about our stay. The room and property were well kept and clean, the breakfast was plentiful and met our needs, and the staff were all very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for couples or a getaway with friends.Thank You, and a special thanks from the staff of The Saint Hotel Key West. We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West.",1
The Wait staff in Bar not so good and not friendly. The rest of was stay was very good. Clean rooms great location for the Duval Crawl. I will be back next time I'm in the area. Being I am a fan of Key west I wanted to try something differentThank you for your feedback and I will share this with the Food Beverage manager so that this is a single occurance. We hope to have another chance to serve you on your next trip to Key West!,1
"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay.",1
"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!",1
"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review.",1
"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.",1
"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future.",1
"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!",0
"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment. Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence. Thank You once again",1
"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West.",1
"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.",0
"Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.",1
"During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming.",1
"With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed",1
"Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal.",1
"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!",1
"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!",1
"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner. This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater.",1
"I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney",1
"I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad).",1
"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service.",1
Very easy check in. Room was clean and comfortable. Service from all employees was good. The food choices are great. The Italian place (Salvatore's I think ) was amazing. Great food and prices with impeccable service. Highly recommended!,1
"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",1
"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again.",1
We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker,1
"Truly a magnificent hotel. Beautiful, spacious rooms massive bathrooms. Not anywhere near the strip, but if you are a hiker/climber, this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon/Spring Mountain Recreation areas. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stay away from the tight slots though.",1
"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute). Views of the strip or mountains, or both if you get a suite. Well located for west Vegas activities. Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby. Will definitely stay there again.",1
With several shows going on everything near the strip that is reasonable was sold out.I stay at Coast Casino hotels most often when in Vegas so decided to try the suncoast. Yes it is a bit off the beaten path but you're back in the action in 15 minutes... That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great...If you like Golf...you're right next door to Angel Park Golf club...didn't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good.,1
Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you.,1
"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",1
"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat.",1
firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended,1
"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast, 2 Queen Sized Bed room. Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms. Large Bathroom, Clean Quiet... Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher.",1
"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!",1
"We just stayed at the Suncoast. The room are very spacious and clean. We had a deluxe King size room - the room, with the pull out couch could easily sleep a family of four. The room we clean and well maintained.We dined at the Italian restaurant - the food was good and the service was about the same. The casino is clean and well vented. The floor service is a little slow, but that is very common now a days.",1
We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!,1
"We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.",1
"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!",1
"For us it was a fabulous location getting on rail to Cubs game and shopping for what we wanted to do. It's was easily accessible for dining as well Everyone in the hotel was very kind and were able to help with any questions we had Hello Pam D,We are glad our location made your visit to Chicago ideal for your Cubs game! Our service level is something we pride ourselves on and glad it showed during your trip. We hope to see you next time in town!",1
The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi. Plenty of shopping and dining in the area. There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel. Across the street is a running / walking path along the river. Great for people watching. Would stay here again.,1
"Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel. We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking. We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,",1
We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.,1
"The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!",1
"This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it. We are so glad you choose The River Hotel for your first visit to Chicago as our prime location makes an ideal base for experiencing all the city has to offer. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!",1
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again.",1
We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.,1
I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!,1
Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.,1
"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",0
"Stayed with my family here and we loved its location and friendly customer services especially from the front desk (Pedro) and cleaning services. I would highly recommend it for business and leisure stay as it is centrally located, proximity to shopping malls, restaurants and the Millennium Park.",1
"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.",1
"The location is amazing... right on the river and within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. I had a great view of the river from the room!Having the water bottle filling stations was a great benefit. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The self checkout was a breeze!Hello Kathleen C,We are happy to hear our location suited you well during your trip. We are lucky to be located right in middle of the city close to everything. We pride ourselves on service and happy to hear we met our goal during your stay. We look forward to seeing you next time in town.",1
"Best price hotel in the city! Great location, walking distances to everything! Staff was professional and friendly. If you needed something, they were on it! Our room was very modern, clean, and beds were comfortable. Very quiet for when you are ready to rest! Classy place.",1
"Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.",0
"The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites.",1
"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!",1
We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!,1
"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!",1
"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!",1
"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience.",1
"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.",1
Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that.,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!",1
"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.",0
"We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family! And it's only a couple blocks to Union Square.Good Morning JudyZ24,We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us. I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay. We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon.Regards,Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham Canterbury at San Francisco",1
"This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus, Staff are very polite and treat you as family member",1
"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!",1
"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website.",0
I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there.,1
"Somehow my booking.com reservation have not reached the hotel so had to wait about half an hour while it was submitted again. Room spacious and clean, heater efficient but pretty noisy, noise from corridor is also thereService could be better - at 0130 at night got a phone call from night manager to immediately re-park the car (evening manager allowed the parking at particular slot). It was outrageousWifi was great and coffee available. For very reasonable price and 1 night stay you can't wish for better",1
"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",0
"Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area.",1
"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene.",1
"I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house. Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future! Kind regards,Eric Gray",1
"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe.",0
"We stayed for one night while passing through on the way to Florida. What a great experience! The staff was so friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable, beautiful and clean. My daughter loved the pool, and it was kept up nicely. Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created.",1
"My stay at the Drury Inn, Atlanta was most enjoyable. The staff was quite courteous, polite and accomadating. The food was good and the hotel was very clean. I will be recommending to family and friends. I will be seeking out other Drury locations. Job well done.!!!!",1
"The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked.",1
"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance.",1
"After an unexpected overnight delay at the Atlanta airport, I was greeted by friendly staff, a clean room and comfy bed! Would absolutely stay here again! The shuttle service was timely and the driver friendly and helpful!",1
"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance.",0
"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away.",1
"I don't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews.Let me just say, we couldn't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel.I did feel sorry for the check in girl. She was alone and it was very busy, but she was very polite and nice.",0
"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.",0
"We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel.",1
My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn.,1
"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!",1

When I arrived at the hotel the service I received from Shannon at the front desk was absolutely amazing.. She helped me take my luggage upstairs without any hesitation.

"We stayed for 6 nights in Cabin 5. It was more spacious than it looked on the website photographs. It did not feel crowded or squished. And the reading room was cute--nice place to sit quietly. The cabins are neither fancy nor shabby, just good old-fashioned cabins with functional kitchenettes or full kitchens that are equipped with most of what... More",1

"I've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels, and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint! Spotlessly clean, with friendly staff, free breakfast and comfortable rooms.

We didn'the try the hotel restaurant, since we were tempted by the aromas of other restaurants while walking the French Quarter.",1
The room was very clean and you can't beat the location. The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life. You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter.,1

We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional.

"We stayed at this motel for 5 months. The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy. We complained about the lighting several times, and also our neighbor's squeaky door without results. Finally we just gave up, and lived with it. We checked... More",0

Traveling with our High School Varsity Girls Basketball team to a Holiday Tournament this past weekend in Boise I spent two nights at the Oxford Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly.

I spent 2 nights in this hotel with friends for a bachelor party. It would have taken very little for this hotel to meet our needs and it still fell short.

The grounds for the hotel was ok....I feel they should advise you that part of the motel is across a 4 lane road...and the rooms can be a lot cleaner than they were.

It was a nice hotel with a good water park for the kids. The continental breakfast was good and they had a good selection of food. The bunk beds for the kids were cheap though and a little wobbly. TV's are old tube televisions which I haven't seen in years.,1
"We looked for a place around the Plaza but most of them were booked or way over priced. Stayed here for less than 100 a night and was very happy. The rooms are spacious, the service is excellent with a nice little bar by night and coffee shop by morning with Starbucks coffee. Received good advice on dining. Rooms were... More",1
"Open plaza design of this Marriott makes it unique. Since it was late Oct when we stayed, it was beginning to get cold, but we were in a room inside a doorway so we didn't have the colder weather right outside our door. We had our own car to drive to Old Town, but they do offer a shuttle to... More",1
Loved having a space that we felt could be our own instead of a motel room. Very clean and everything we needed for cooking. Great location and very pleasant folks to deal with. The fact that we were staying in an historical building made it even more charming.,1
"We stayed here for a night while exploring around Escalante. We were very tired, and the (new) beds were so soft and excellent! We got a great night's sleep here. Nothing fancy but very cozy and warm. (We visited in the winter when morning temps were -10F)",1
We reserved several rooms for our large group. We were impressed with how clean and comfortable our rooms were. We loved the guidebooks in the room and the friendly staff. We used the fire pit to roast hot dogs and marshmallows and appreciated the free firewood. This was a great location-- across the street from a fantastic pizza place and... More,1
"Love this place. Wanda checked us in after 2 days of camping. She is worth her or my weight in gold !!! Found her in the restaurant at night, she was everywhere and always with a smile and warm welcome. What a find, best place in town. On the westside of town with a Spanish adobe look. The room had...

"Searching for a family reunion site for 50+ folks in Buffalo, WY - we found this place by accident when driving by. Jim, the owner, greeted us and was extremely helpful in determining if this property would work. Besides, cabins for couples families with kids, we need a central place to cook out, eat, sit around watching the fire... More",1
"My wife loved the exterior from the moment she saw the house, and she liked our room as well. I think the older style of the house and rooms enhanced our stay in Amish country. The breakfast was tasty, and the hosts catered to my wife's and mother's dietary restrictions. The hosts were friendly, and I felt welcome in their... More",1
On arrival my husband and I needed to walk through the overgrown shrubbery to get to the front door and it had just rained. Needless to say our pants and shoes were wet. Our first impression on entering the premises was that it was very run down. To me there was an odor. It needed new floors and paint. When... More,0
Hal and Karen - CT We've been staying at the CMV for many years. It's a good value. The rooms are not fancy but very clean and comfortable. If you're looking for the Ritz this isn't it but it's a great place in an ideal location. The restaurant is great. Very good selection with excellent flat bread pizza and great... More,1

"Went for dinner and food was amazing. Only problem was the owner ray was wasted, knocking drinks over and we stayed all weekend and every night he was drunk. My gf said he wouldn't stop gropping her. Nice place but needs new ownership.",0
"I recently stayed at Brewster By the Sea while visiting my parents. This is the sister property to the Captain Freeman Inn in Brewster. Our stay was perfect and I knew it would be as I've stayed at the sister property twice. Our room was lovely. A 4 poster king bed, fireplace and comfy chairs..Impeccably kept property. Breakfast was fantastic... More",1
"After reading the reviews of this place I decided to take a chance. I was pleasantly surprised! It was very clean and smelled good! The bed was comfortable with a bunch of nice pillows. Fridge, microwave and coffee pot in the room. The only thing that was sort of a pain was the toilet. It was difficult to flush! I... More",1
"We rented a cabin/cottage from Birch Bay Get Away for a few days over the Christmas holiday. Our cottage - Sandlewood - offered two bedrooms, full bath, living room and compete kitchen at an extremely reasonable rate. Plus dogs are welcome for an additional/nominal fee. Everything was clean, comfortable, and only a short walk to the beach. We were delighted... More",1
"Simple hotel, good stay. Easy access to gas station, food and dessert places. Rooms are nice, no huge complaints, had a small issue with hot water/shower but the hotel addressed and solved the issue quickly.",1
Good Hotel with reasonable rates. It was situated near highway 8. THe car noise was too much during the night and disturbed sleep. I will suggest other people to use this facility. Continental breakfast was fine in the AM,1
I wish I could give this hotel zero stars Pro the continental breakfast was decent Cons what the hell does that room 217 reek of PABLO the manager .. Refused to do anything about a room that smelled like crap MARIA the house keeper is a liar saying she smelled it but it was something we did to make it... More,0
"This hotel, though not new, is very well kept up. The bed is very comfortable and the property is clean and well kept. The location is good. I needed to be in Apache Junction early Saturday morning. I was only a 30 minute drive away. I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know. The breakfast was nutrisious and hot.... More",1
"I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel is very clean, modern, odor and scent-free and well-decorated. The room was well-appointed. The shower was a bit weak. The heater was quiet. The exercise room was merely adequate but very clean. Valet parking is 18 daily.",1
"I have been staying here for 4 years when I visit my son who attends Boise State. Always a great experience, they let me check in early, rooms are comfortable and spacious and the breakfast is great. It is a great location and the hotel staff will drop off at most locations within Boise.",1
"I live close by, and needed to stay somewhere for a night due to renovation work at home. I called at 9:30 PM, and they had a room available. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was very comfortable, and we had a sound night's sleep. The check in was smooth, and seeing wild turkeys in he tree out... More",1
Rolled in 11:30 laid out heads down woke up to continental breakfast and rolled out at daybreak. It is under construction but heat they have done so far is beautiful. Very nice updated pool area for an older motel. The staff was super nice,1
"Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help.",0
